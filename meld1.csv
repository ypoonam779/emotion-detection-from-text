joy,"Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you?"
sadness,"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
joy,"Now get on out of here, you!"
neutral,Hey Bob.
joy,Hey! How’s my pal Toby doing today?
neutral,"If I see him, I’ll ask."
joy,Toby!
joy,Yeah!
neutral,Oh then you know each other.
neutral,We’re on a semi-first name basis.
neutral,What do you think of adding him to our team?
neutral,But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.
joy,Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
neutral,A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
joy,"No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux!"
joy,That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.
anger,You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!
neutral,So?
sadness,So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
anger,"Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say ""I do,"" he’s thinking, ""Yeah, I’d do her too!"""
neutral,Well then we still have a problem.
neutral,Yeah!
neutral,With what?
neutral,"Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies."
joy,Oo! You should have one of us do it!
neutral,"Phoebe, we’re getting"
joy,No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
joy,I call it!!
anger,What?! No! It was my idea!
neutral,Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
anger,Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
neutral,"We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!"
joy,"See, I see.... big passion in your future."
neutral,I do.
joy,"Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]"
neutral,"That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why."
neutral,"Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions."
neutral,"Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
neutral,"Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side."
neutral,"Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill."
neutral,You can spill. In the sink.
sadness,"Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening."
joy,"I love you, too."
joy,"Aww, good.  What?"
sadness,What? I’m just said.
neutral,"No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is."
neutral,Uh-huh.
joy,I would love to live with you Ross.. that’s-that’s great! Thank you!
neutral,"Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out."
joy,"Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!"
sadness,"I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless."
joy,You just saved me!
joy,You’re my hero!
neutral,"Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right."
joy,"Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!"
joy,"Oh please!   You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya?"
neutral,No.
neutral,"No, I won’t."
neutral,"But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise."
anger,"She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!"
anger,"...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?"
joy,"Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
neutral,Lose the robe.
joy,That's great.
neutral,"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
neutral,"No, no, I'm still working on mine."
sadness,"Yeah, it was really hard."
neutral,"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
anger,"Ok, you weren't there."
joy,"Wow! That’s ah, that’s pretty nice!"
neutral,Pretty nice?
neutral,"You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
neutral,"We don’t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We’ve got a canoe."
neutral,"Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe."
anger,You gotta take the canoe!
neutral,"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!"
anger,We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
anger,Good for you!!
neutral,Pheebs?
neutral,Yeah?
neutral,"Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen."
neutral,"Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
neutral,What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
neutral,Are you travelling with a child?
neutral,No.
neutral,"All right, y’know what, she’s  gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card."
neutral,"Okay, but this is the last time."
joy,"With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there."
joy,"Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen."
neutral,Hey.
neutral,Hey.
neutral,How’s she doing?
neutral,"Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?"
neutral,"I don’t know.  I can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly."
neutral,"Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks."
neutral,What?
joy,"Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince."
neutral,"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
neutral,"Well sensitive is important, pick him."
neutral,Yeah.
anger,Jason is not a sissy!
anger,"Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler."
neutral,Hi.
neutral,"So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?"
neutral,Yeah.
neutral,"Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter."
neutral,"I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way."
neutral,I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.
joy,It was an amazing night.
joy,It was. It was an amazing night.
sadness,You think it looked amazing?
neutral,Do we have a name yet?
neutral,"No, not yet."
neutral,"That’s fine, for now we’ll just call her Baby Girl Green."
neutral,"Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green."
joy,Hello baby girl.
joy,"Ah-ha, nowhere to run!"
anger,I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over
anger,No Rachel! They got here first!
neutral,Why is Ross doing that?
fear,DANGER
neutral,No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
joy,Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
neutral,Yeah! Look!
neutral,I know.
neutral,"All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food."
neutral,"Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?"
joy,"I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!"
neutral,Also so
neutral,"Oh, in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!"
neutral,"Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!"
neutral,"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you."
neutral,About what?
neutral,He's planning your birthday party.
joy,Oh my God! I love him!
neutral,About what?
joy,Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
neutral,"Well, he didn't tell me."
neutral,"Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing."
anger,This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
neutral,"No, you are not. We tell you stuff."
anger,Yuh-huh!
anger,I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
anger,I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
neutral,"Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad."
neutral,"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation."
anger,Chandler! He’s your father.  he should be at the wedding.
sadness,Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!
neutral,It’s not like we run in the same circles.
neutral,"Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles."
neutral,So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.
neutral,"Okay, I think I need to do some shopping."
neutral,Hello! Who’s in there?
neutral,How ya doin’?
anger,Who in the hell are you?
neutral,"I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?"
fear,"No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!"
anger,"No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!"
anger,I’m not gonna marry Chandler!
anger,Not after this!
neutral,"Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo."
neutral,I gotta go.
sadness,"Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it."
neutral,"Sorry I'm late, but I left late."
neutral,Okay.
neutral,"So Pheebs, what is the book about?"
neutral,I thought you said you read it in high school.
neutral,"Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?"
neutral,"Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?"
neutral,"Y'know what, actually…  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?"
neutral,"Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?"
neutral,"Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?"
neutral,"But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time."
neutral,We get high.
neutral,"Oh, me too."
neutral,I'm kidding.
joy,"Oh, me too."
sadness,"Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
neutral,Yeah.
sadness,Does it still hurt?
sadness,Yeah.
joy,What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
neutral,Hi.
neutral,"Hey, how'd it go?"
joy,Excellent.
joy,"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves."
joy,"What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
neutral,You know what? You are right. I
joy,Good for you Pheebs!
neutral,Ok.
neutral,"Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean"
anger,This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!
neutral,It’s 6:00.
joy,Hi!
neutral,"Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well."
neutral,Handling it?
joy,"What do you mean, handling it?"
joy,There’s nothing to handle.
neutral,"Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua."
anger,"Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!"
anger,Come on!
neutral,"And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off."
joy,"I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s."
anger,"What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?!"
anger,This sucks!
neutral,"All right, what’s my next present?"
neutral,"All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?"
neutral,Enhh
neutral,I’ve got canned goods.
neutral,"Excellent hole, Joe."
neutral,My drinking?
neutral,"Oh, I must’ve said that after you left."

anger,If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it!
sadness,I don’t want to lose you.
neutral,"What if I, create a position for you?"
neutral,I’ll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
joy,Say more things like that.
joy,"You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow."
neutral,I’d need an expense account.
joy,Done!
neutral,And an assistant.
joy,"Sophie, get in here!"
joy,Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
neutral,They're male nurses.
neutral,Not in my head.
joy,"Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?"
joy,Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
anger,You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
neutral,"I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me."
neutral,"Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go."
neutral,"Umm, why don't you give"
neutral,Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?

neutral,"Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right."
joy,Hey!
joy,Hey!
joy,Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
joy,"Oh boy, me too!"
neutral,Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
fear,Yeah?
neutral,"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!"
anger,"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!"
joy,That’s me! Come on!
neutral,"Okay.  But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch."
neutral,"Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
anger,Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
neutral,I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
joy,Hi! Nice to meet you!
neutral,Nice to meet you too.
neutral,"So, are you ready to go?"
neutral,Yeah.
anger,Chandler!
neutral,I’ll be right with you.
neutral,"Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple."
neutral,Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
neutral,You can take it off.
fear,Just slice that baby right off!
neutral,"Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?"
neutral,Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
neutral,Well that's not a third nipple.
neutral,"First of all, it's on your ass."
neutral,"Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?"
neutral,I'm with Hamilton!
neutral,"He's good with rear things, bring him in too."
joy,"Umm, this is great wine."
neutral,"It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe."
joy,"Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona."

neutral,"Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this."
neutral,Oh. Well then shut me up.
neutral,Just tell me how.
fear,"Uh-oh, I feel another one coming."
neutral,"Let it go, Ross."
neutral,"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi."
neutral,Do you all promise?
neutral,Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
joy,"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!"
neutral,"Hey, Pheebs."
neutral,Dear Ms. Buffay.
neutral,Thank you for calling attention to our error.

neutral,Yeah? The work problem?
joy,Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
neutral,What problem did you tell him you had?
neutral,"Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay."
neutral,"Okay, I’ve got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?"
anger,"Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha!"
joy,"Very good,  so good."
joy,"I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic."
sadness,"Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call."
sadness,I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club.
sadness,"Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!"
joy,Come on! Look where you are!!
neutral,"When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris."
neutral,"Remember, a virgin for me please."
neutral,Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
neutral,"Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy."
neutral,"Well, if you think it will help."
anger,No!
fear,That was a test!
fear,In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!
fear,"And then after that, I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice"
anger,Ohhh!!
joy,I think somebody needs another lap dance.
neutral,"All right, I definitely taste nutmeg."
anger,That and arrogance.
neutral,Hey.
joy,Hey! How was sailing?
joy,Wow thanks!
fear,Joe?
joy,Yeah!
neutral,"Uh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?"
fear,"Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted to, but I couldn’t…."
fear,"There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident."
neutral,"Don’t worry about that man, that happens."
neutral,Yeah! Once.

anger,"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!"
anger,"Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!"
neutral,"Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
anger,Do you always have to bring him here?
neutral,I didn't wanna leave him alone.
neutral,Alright?
neutral,We- we had our first fight this morning.
neutral,I think it has to do with my working late.
neutral,"I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces..."
neutral,"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
joy,"Oh, that'd be great!"
neutral,"Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
neutral,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
neutral,Check this out.
neutral,"""It’s almost as good as being there."""
joy,It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!
joy,Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
neutral,"Uh, may I help you?"
neutral,"Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed."

neutral,"So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?"
neutral,"I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore."
sadness,"Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a"
neutral,Yeah.
neutral,"My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal."
neutral,I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
sadness,"No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he’s gonna double the college money my Grandma left me."
joy,"Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea."
neutral,"Oh. Look, just friends, I won’t grope you. I promise."
joy,"No, I just I think that it’s too soon."
neutral,"No it’s not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven."
neutral,I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
neutral,Exactly.
joy,"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?"
anger,It’s not a real game! I made it up!
joy,"I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square."
neutral,I don't know.
neutral,But I can see through your sheet.
neutral,"Yeah, yeah, that's her."
neutral,But y'know what?
sadness,"Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway."

neutral,Okay.
sadness,I’m sorry.
fear,"You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game."

neutral,"Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you…."
joy,"Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food."
joy,"Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth."
neutral,"Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you?"
neutral,"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?"
neutral,"I mean really, think about it."
neutral,"Ho-ho, I will."
anger,"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!"

neutral,"Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put."
neutral,I think it’s best sir.
neutral,But we really do need to find someone up here.
neutral,The work is starting to pile up.

sadness,"It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know."
neutral,Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.
anger,You think you know me so well.

sadness,"Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives."
neutral,"Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
neutral,"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
neutral,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
joy,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."

neutral,"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
anger,"Aw, I know all about Kip!"
anger,"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
sadness,"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
sadness,"Aw, don't do that"

anger,You are asking me to be your wife!
neutral,And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
joy,"I know, I know, I'm such an idiot."
neutral,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
neutral,"Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-"
neutral,#NAME?
neutral,"That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch."
sadness,"Barry, I'm sorry..."
sadness,I am so sorry...
sadness,"I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway..."
neutral,"No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan."

sadness,"Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him."
anger,Go!
anger,"I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit."
neutral,I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
neutral,Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
fear,"Uh, let’s rip!"

joy,"‘Cause every time I see your face, I can’t help but fall from grace. I know....."
anger,"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before."
neutral,I like her.

sadness,"Oh, I hate this story."
neutral,We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
sadness,"I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
sadness,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

fear,Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
joy,What’s going on Rach?
fear,"Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?"
joy,"Y’know, I’m actually glad Phoebe called."
joy,"I know we broke up because you thought I wasn’t mature enough, but I’ve really grown up and think we should get back together."

neutral,"Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler."
neutral,It’s you. This is yours.
joy,Look how nervous he gets! We haven’t slept together in years!
fear,That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
anger,"Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do you want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!"
neutral,"Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here."

anger,"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??"
neutral,Yeah...
anger,And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?
neutral,Yeah...
anger,"OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory?"
neutral,"Oh, that's Ross's."
neutral,Remembered what?
sadness,"We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl."

anger,"I do not always have to be—okay, okay."
neutral,Jurassic Park
fear,"I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night."
neutral,Maybe we should check the trash chute.
neutral,Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
neutral,"That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there."
neutral,Hey!
joy,There he is!
anger,Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!
neutral,"Just, y'know out."
anger,"Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!"
neutral,What were you doing?
neutral,"I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while."
anger,"Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!"

neutral,"Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it’s not your fault."
joy,"Wow, that’s great."

neutral,"Y'know you could totally sell this. It’d be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign."
neutral,"I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no."
neutral,"Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y'know."
neutral,You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
neutral,"Aw, you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry."
joy,"That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’s really, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up."
neutral,"Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right."
neutral,"Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?"
joy,"Okay, great."
joy,Thank you.
neutral,"Um, coffee to go, please."
neutral,Isabella Rosselini.
anger,Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.
neutral,Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?
neutral,"Yeah, maybe."
neutral,What you don’t think I’d go up to her?
neutral,"Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me."
anger,"Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated."
neutral,"You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate."
neutral,"Okay, hold my crawler."
neutral,Okay.
joy,"Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just sorry we don’t got popcorn."
neutral,"Okay, that's, that's enough."
neutral,Won't you dance around with me.
joy,"Oh-oh-oh, yeah!  That's right, you take good care of those babies!"
joy,"It's me, Joey!"
joy,Joey!
neutral,"Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy."
neutral,Okay that’s fair.
neutral,All right.
neutral,Good!
neutral,Pick one.
joy,Left!  Thank you.
neutral,You’re welcome.
neutral,Joey!  We should just switch.
joy,Yeah absolutely!
sadness,"Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you."
joy,Oh that’s all right!
joy,"Y’know, I ended up having a really good time."
joy,"Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness."
neutral,So what was it for anyway?
neutral,I wanna say a disease.
neutral,I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on
neutral,Oh-oh Professor Geller.
neutral,"Ahh, to be 13 again."
neutral,"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?"
anger,No! He blew us off!
anger,I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.
anger,Can I tell you something? Me too.
anger,"Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him"
joy,Ooooh! Freeze him out.
joy,That’s right!
joy,I like it!
neutral,Doorknob?
neutral,"Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation."
joy,Oh good.
fear,"Look, I…  Look, I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us."
sadness,"So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet."
fear,It’s-it’s too soon.
joy,You are so adorable.
joy,That! Let’s talk about that.
joy,Hey!
neutral,How do you feel?
neutral,"Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
neutral,"Okay, so I"
neutral,And protected them from a tornado?
neutral,"I know, the babies are asleep."
joy,I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
neutral,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
neutral,"You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out."
neutral,‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
neutral,When will that be?
anger,"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!"
joy,Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!
joy,It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
joy,"Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?"
joy,Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping
neutral,A dreamless sleep.
joy,"So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!"
neutral,"Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!"
neutral,Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
neutral,Okay.
neutral,When are you coming home?
neutral,"C'mon, this is us."
neutral,I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
neutral,"Okay, I'm not just waitressing."
neutral,I'm..
neutral,"I, um..."
neutral,"I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh..."
sadness,"I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies."
neutral,"We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?"
neutral,"So, um, will you bring the truck?"
neutral,I'll even let you ring the bell.
joy,"See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
neutral,They're nice guys.
joy,"Oh, they're firemen guys."
neutral,Your son.
anger,"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie."
neutral,"Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie."
anger,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp."
neutral,I got it.
neutral,I got it.
anger,"I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps."
neutral,"No, you don't."
anger,"All right, that's it. I want both of you out."
anger,He started it!
anger,"No, you started it."
anger,"I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier."
anger,Now go!
anger,Thanks a lot.
anger,See what you did.
neutral,"Yeah, listen..."
anger,Out
joy,"Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?"
neutral,"Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight."
neutral,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi."
neutral,"Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times."
neutral,You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.
neutral,Boutros Boutros Gali.
neutral,He says he was too.
neutral,Interesting.
neutral,So I was wondering....
joy,"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit."
joy,"Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun."
neutral,So you're a chef?
joy,I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
neutral,"Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?"
neutral,"Well, I was having a conversation."
anger,"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other."
anger,What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
neutral,That would be great. Thank you.
neutral,"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time."
neutral,Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!
joy,"Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it."
anger,"Oh, damn! I got it on my pants."
neutral,"Here, I'll get it."
neutral,We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
joy,Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
joy,"Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!"
sadness,"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach."
neutral,Action!
anger,I found the picture!
anger,The picture of my wife! In your pack!
anger,You went through my personal property?
anger,Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
anger,"Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!"
joy,Cut! Wonderful!
joy,Great scene yeah?
joy,"Oh you’re awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me."
neutral,Here’s your call sheet for tomorrow.
neutral,I know.
joy,"So Chandler, your parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged."
neutral,"Oh yeah, I should probably call them."
joy,I remember when we first got engaged.
neutral,"Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story."
joy,"Well, I’d gotten Judy pregnant. I still don’t know how that happened."
neutral,What a sweet story.
joy,"Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund."
fear,"You tell her Jack, I can’t do it."
neutral,"We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house."
neutral,"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,"
joy,Did that!
neutral,Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
neutral,"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad."
anger,That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
neutral,"But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest."
neutral,"Now umm, remember I’m still learning."
neutral,"One, two, three, four!"
joy,You know the song! Sing along!
neutral,So?
sadness,No!
neutral,David who?
sadness,"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!"
neutral,"Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around."
neutral,"Yeah, I’m just, I’m just in town for a conference. Umm,"
joy,Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
neutral,Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
neutral,Yeah.
joy,Yes! Santa's coming!
sadness,"Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today."
neutral,"It’s no big deal. Hey, y’know, you do what you gotta do. Right?"
neutral,"But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides"
neutral,Whatever.
neutral,"Okay, Mon, back me up here."
neutral,"Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?"
neutral,"And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?"
sadness,I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
neutral,"Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal."
sadness,"Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it."
neutral,"Y’know, hey I understand."
neutral,Y’know?
neutral,"Hey, when I’m in a play and you’re in the audience, I don’t talk to you, right?"
neutral,"So it’s y’know, it’s uh, it’s cool."
neutral,I’ll see you tomorrow.
neutral,"Yeah, when we’re in the audience he doesn’t talk to us, but he does wave."
joy,You did look like an idiot.
neutral,"Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot."
neutral,All right?
joy,"Remember when Ross tried to say, ""Butternut squash?"""
joy,"And it came out, ""Squatternut buash?"""
neutral,Yeah that's the same.
sadness,That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
neutral,Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
sadness,"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story."
neutral,"Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about."
sadness,"Y'know, for me anyway."
sadness,"And of course, the Indians."
anger,"Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!"
neutral,"Hi, guys."
joy,Hi! Phoebe.
neutral,Hi Phoebe.
sadness,"I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know."
neutral,No we

neutral,"hormones, yeah."
neutral,Your parents’?
neutral,"Yeah, they’re out of town."
neutral,"Yeah-yeah, it’s this"
neutral,Yeah that works.
fear,They-they-they can smell fear.
joy,Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
neutral,"Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?"
neutral,"Yes, hi."
joy,"Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M."
sadness,"I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry."
joy,"Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!"
neutral,No leg-chewing for us sir.
neutral,"Oh well, give it time."
joy,"So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lot to celebrate."
neutral,How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
joy,"Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six."
joy,They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
joy,"Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow!"
neutral,"Just so you know, we’re not seeing him tomorrow."
neutral,No.
neutral,"Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs"
neutral,"How many times have I told you guys, you"
neutral,Hi Chandler.
neutral,Hey!
neutral,"Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day."
sadness,"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars."
neutral,William Sonoma
neutral,Expect it in 4-6 weeks.
neutral,"Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
neutral,"Yeah, so?"
neutral,"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had."
neutral,"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass."
neutral,Why?
neutral,What's your point?
neutral,"So uh, what’s your name?"
neutral,It's Jake.
neutral,"Joey.  Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?"
neutral,"Yeah, big fan."
joy,"Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?"
joy,Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I’m not doing anything Tuesday.
neutral,Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?
joy,"Ahh, nooo!!"
joy,"Oh, great!"
neutral,"Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery."
neutral,"I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp."
joy,"You’re a genius, Ross."
neutral,"Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?"
neutral,"Okay, I’ll pay you tomorrow."
sadness,"So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?"
neutral,"Yeah, okay, bye."
neutral,So I’m gonna take off then!
joy,"Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it."
neutral,"Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime."
neutral,"Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back."
neutral,"Yeah, sure.  All right, whose court is the ball in now?"
neutral,I thought there wasn't a ball?
neutral,"Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!"
neutral,"Rachel, this is my friend Tom."
joy,You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
neutral,So you work at
neutral,"Yeah, okay, at ease solider!"
neutral,"No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy."
sadness,"I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend."
joy,Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
neutral,I think I need a drink.
joy,Yeah!
neutral,"Hey, Pheebs?"
anger,"No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!"
sadness,"Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again."
neutral,"And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready."
joy,Uh-huh!
joy,Wow! Cool!
neutral,Was the chord at least right
anger,No!
neutral,"Well, this has been fun."
joy,"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life."
neutral,"Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya."
neutral,"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457."
neutral,"And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."
neutral,We’re beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
joy,I’m really glad we came.  You’re so pretty. I love you.
neutral,"Okay, that’s a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah."
neutral,"Excuse me, I’m sorry, I’m gonna have to call you back, I’ve got a Schemp in my office."
neutral,What are you doing?
neutral,I’m sorry.
neutral,"But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how ‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again."
neutral,"Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop."
neutral,"Come on Rach, you don’t have what, ten minutes?"
anger,I don’t have ten minutes!!
neutral,"What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?"
anger,"Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!"
sadness,"Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week."
neutral,"Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I’ve got a deadline, would you just go home, I’ll talk to you later."
neutral,"Yeah, but wait..."
neutral,Good bye!
neutral,"Actually, that’s our three hole punch."
neutral,I'll tell you what.
neutral,"When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
neutral,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
anger,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
neutral,"No, no, no."
anger,What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
neutral,"Uh, uh."
neutral,Hey.
neutral,"Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?"
neutral,"No, I haven't seen him."
neutral,"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?"
neutral,"Yeah, why?"
neutral,No reason.
joy,I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!
joy,"Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!"
neutral,"Yeah, that’s her."
neutral,Thank you.
neutral,Y’know what would work?
anger,Stop making candy!
neutral,You mean they like you.
neutral,Maybe.
anger,"Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?"
anger,"We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’"
joy,"Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!"
joy,‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
joy,"I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then."
neutral,"I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go."
neutral,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8"
sadness,I can’t do it!
neutral,"Now you do that, you’re on TV."
joy,Hey!
neutral,"So, what are you guys in the market for? We’ve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards..."
neutral,Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?
neutral,"Well, I don’t have to buy that, ""I’m with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
neutral,"Well, I like it. Here you go."
anger,"All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
neutral,How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?
neutral,Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
neutral,They’re all tourists.
neutral,Oh yeah?  If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
anger,Good choice.
joy,Thanks.
anger,"Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!"
anger,"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else."
neutral,"And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my"
anger,You don't even know me...
sadness,"The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this."
sadness,"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe..."
neutral,"No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?"
neutral,Oh yeah.
neutral,"Okay, forward. Forward—Stop!  Okay, back—Stop!  Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!"
neutral,"Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do."
neutral,"Okay, I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral."
neutral,You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.
neutral,Okay?
neutral,"All right, here we go."
neutral,Haul ass!!!
neutral,"So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain."
neutral,So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
joy,...and live forever as a machine!
joy,"That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?"
neutral,"You and I, we're interfacing."
fear,"Yeah, I gotta go."
joy,Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
neutral,"David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air."
neutral,"Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion."
neutral,See?
fear,"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
neutral,"Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
neutral,"Oh, I should go, too."
neutral,"Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there."
anger,"Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there."
sadness,"And she was like ""Oh, don't worry!"
neutral,I asked him.
anger,"He's totally ok with seeing you!""."
joy,So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
anger,"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
neutral,Exactly!
neutral,And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
anger,"I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,"
neutral,"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something."
joy,"Ok, that'll be great!"
joy,"Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me."
neutral,Hello Skidmark.
neutral,"It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later."
neutral,It’s pretty clear.
neutral,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight."
sadness,"You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!"
joy,Ni-chou chi-ma!
neutral,Hi everyone.
neutral,"I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before."
neutral,"Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey."
fear,"What did, what did he say?"
neutral,"Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know."
neutral,"So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so."
joy,"Oh, great!"
joy,"We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck."
joy,"Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly."
joy,"All I could think of was y’know, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"""
neutral,And did he?
joy,"I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself."
neutral,"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it."
joy,I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.
joy,"Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler."
sadness,"Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again, am I?"
sadness,I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
sadness,"I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again."
neutral,You’ll have a last kiss.
joy,Thank you so much for coming back over.
sadness,"Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable."
neutral,"I know Mona, just hear me out."
neutral,"First of all, I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own."
neutral,You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.
neutral,Focus.
neutral,"Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are"
neutral,All right where’s that turkey!
joy,Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
neutral,No.
anger,No!
joy,"Oh, would you look at that Monica?"
joy,"I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad."
anger,"Okay, I’m next.  Don’t! Don’t start another game! I said I’m next! Phoebe!"
joy,"Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning."
anger,Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!
neutral,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
neutral,Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
neutral,"Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work."
joy,But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
sadness,"I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!"
sadness,Or Friday with no two pizzas!
sadness,All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.
joy,No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!
neutral,"All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?"
joy,That’s right!
joy,‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani!
neutral,And this is what we do!
joy,We can eat!
joy,Look at this!
joy,Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
neutral,Hi.
neutral,Hi.
anger,"Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?"
neutral,Okay. Let’s use this brush.
neutral,Okay. This stuff?
neutral,Yeah.
neutral,All right.
neutral,"Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it."
sadness,Okay-Dokey
neutral,Where exactly is your zoo?
neutral,"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience."
neutral,"Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?"
neutral,Yes.
neutral,"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?"
neutral,"No-no, he's, he's very docile."
neutral,Even if he were... cornered?
neutral,"Well I, I don't know. Why?"
neutral,"Uh, how is he at handling small objects?"
neutral,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
neutral,"How about a hammer, or a small blade?"
neutral,Otherwise it's just cruel.
joy,"He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego."
neutral,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..."
neutral,...He's in.
joy,"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"
neutral,"I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains."
neutral,My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
joy,Really helped speed the process along!
neutral,Sid is still in his room.
joy,I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.
neutral,Did you make your deposit?
joy,Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
fear,"That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?"
joy,I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
neutral,"Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is."
fear,"Phoebe, where's your purse?"
anger,"No, no! Give it to me!"
anger,You can't have it.
anger,Give it to me!
anger,No
anger,I'll go in there.
anger,Oh yeah.

anger,You. Like you haven’t done enough.
neutral,"Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do."
neutral,I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
neutral,"Because with seahorses it’s the male, they carry the babies."
anger,"And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea."
joy,God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
neutral,"Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end"

sadness,"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!"
sadness,"Yeah, well, don’t “Aww Pheebs, that sucks!” me yet."
neutral,Where ya going?
neutral,"Well, she’s out of town so, there’s gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is."

neutral,"Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry."
sadness,"All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out."
neutral,"Ok, you can do this."
neutral,It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
neutral,"Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed."
sadness,"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice."
anger,"All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it."
neutral,Go for it.
neutral,"I’m just saying, get his number just in case."
neutral,But no: Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
joy,"Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m engaged."
joy,"I did, but that was really fun."
neutral,Hey.
neutral,Chandler. I sensed it was you.
neutral,Unagi. I’m always aware.
joy,"Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?"
neutral,What’s up?
neutral,I can’t figure out what to make Monica.
anger,"Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes."
fear,I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
neutral,Y’know what?
neutral,She’d-she’d love this.
neutral,"Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8."
neutral,I made it in the sixth grade.
neutral,"Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon."
neutral,"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon."
joy,"But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
neutral,"Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her."
neutral,Why not?
neutral,"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom."
anger,Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
neutral,He might still show up.
anger,"Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours."
neutral,Is that all?
sadness,"I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?"
neutral,"Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding."
neutral,"Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony."
neutral,We’re not even sure why we’re having it.
neutral,It’s actually going to be just family.
neutral,"Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me."
joy,Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
joy,"Oh great! What, you brought Joey?"

anger,I can’t figure this out!
sadness,It’s so hard!
sadness,Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah!
sadness,Paper cut!
neutral,"Now, have you told anyone else?"
neutral,"No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out."
anger,"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
neutral,Me too.
neutral,Hey.
neutral,Hey.
joy,"Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?"
neutral,Oh all right.
neutral,"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go."

joy,You lost the ring!
anger,You’re the worst best man ever!
anger,"Dude, this isn’t funny!"
fear,What am I gonna do?!
joy,"I go to bed last night, everything’s cool!"
fear,"I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!"
fear,Of course!!
anger,What difference does that make?!
anger,"Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!"
neutral,"Joey, do you have a minute?"
fear,"Dude, what am I gonna"
anger,"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out."
fear,"Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!"
neutral,"Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place."
neutral,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have"
neutral,"What-what is it, what is it?"
fear,"Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!"
anger,"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!"
fear,"I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone"
anger,I'm not listening to you!
joy,Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!
anger,"Hey, come on now!"
neutral,"All right, what are we havin’?"
neutral,"Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, just everything in moderation."
neutral,I’ll take those to go.  For the kids.
neutral,"Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?"
anger,"It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said."
neutral,"But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today."
neutral,"Understood. So, what’d you say back then?"
neutral,"Well, I said that I"
neutral,Ha!
joy,So you like the drums!
joy,"That's, that's great!"
neutral,"Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation."
sadness,"All right, okay, well, apparently not!"
joy,"So, yay!"
neutral,"Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four..."
joy,Tequila!!
joy,That's fun.
sadness,Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
anger,I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
fear,"Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it."
anger,"That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed."
neutral,"All right that’s it, school is in session!"
neutral,"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times."
neutral,So why don’t you quit?
joy,You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I
neutral,Who is Maria?
joy,"Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat."
neutral,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
anger,No!
neutral,So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?
fear,"Oh no, you’ll have to come."
neutral,"Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that."
anger,Exactly! Because it's in the past!
neutral,Anybody gonna eat that?
joy,Pheebs!
joy,Hey!
neutral,"Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?"
neutral,Yeah!
neutral,I know. They were mine.
neutral,"No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on."
neutral,I’m wearing his briefs right now.
joy,I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
neutral,"Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that."
joy,And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
neutral,There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.
neutral,I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear!
neutral,I don’t think you could ever do that.
neutral,Hey! I
neutral,Lusts of the flesh.

joy,"Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!"
neutral,"Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya."
joy,Hey!
neutral,Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
neutral,"Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my  breast?"
neutral,"It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don’t worry. It’ll happen."
anger,Yowza
neutral,"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth."
neutral,"I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?"
neutral,"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…"
neutral,Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?
neutral,She looks scared.
neutral,Doesn’t she  look scared?
neutral,"Y’know, I don’t really know her."
neutral,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
neutral,"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
neutral,"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
neutral,"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the ""a-gogo."""
neutral,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
sadness,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
anger,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me."
neutral,The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
anger,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
neutral,Pathetic mess?
neutral,"I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable."
joy,"I'm thinkin', cha-ching!"
neutral,Thanks.
neutral,"Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice."
neutral,You're doin' this.

joy,"Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!"""
neutral,Oh so-so not really never.
neutral,I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
neutral,"I mean after all we’ve been through, I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate."
neutral,"Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing."
joy,"Oh-ho, and mine!"
fear,No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
neutral,Well…I only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.
sadness,"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?"
sadness,"It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!"
neutral,Chandler?
sadness,I-I’m sorry?
sadness,"No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!"
sadness,Oh yeah?
neutral,I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
sadness,I’ve been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one’s even looked up from their desk.
neutral,Hang-hang on.
neutral,Hey everybody!
sadness,"Uh, I’m gonna kill myself!"
neutral,I got nothing.
fear,What am I going to do?
neutral,"Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy."
fear,"Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here."
neutral,"No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!"
neutral,That’s not a bad idea.
neutral,"Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys."
joy,"Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs."
neutral,"So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?"
sadness,Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.
neutral,"Yeah, you wish."
joy,"""You wish."""
joy,Why are you yelling?
neutral,"Whoa, that"
neutral,Well… It’s a date.
sadness,"Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this."

neutral,"Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S."
fear,I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
sadness,And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
neutral,"Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?"
sadness,Oh.
fear,"Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’"
anger,"We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff."
neutral,"He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary."
neutral,Hey.
neutral,"So are ready for the gym? They’ve got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other."
neutral,"No, I can spot you from here."

joy,"Oh yeah, I’d love that."
joy,"Oh, great! Me too."

neutral,And why do you care so much?

neutral,"We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?"
neutral,What-what is love really?
neutral,"Ohhh, I"
neutral,I am a good kisser.
neutral,"Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in…  I’ve been watching too much porn."
neutral,So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
joy,"Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I"
neutral,Why don’t we do a trial run.
neutral,"Oh okay. Umm, all right.  Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?"

anger,"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!"
neutral,"Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule."
anger,I don’t accept this rule.
anger,"When we make plans, I expect you to show up."
anger,"Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!"

sadness,There’s one thing missing.
neutral,What’s that?
neutral,It’s time for me to conquer the physical world.
neutral,Okay.
neutral,"Monica, I want to become  the Ultimate Fighting Champion."
joy,"I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It’s the most intense physical competition in the world, it’s banned in 49 states!"

joy,"Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win."
joy,I want you close enough to smell the blood.
neutral,What do you think?
neutral,Okay to come in?
neutral,"Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again."
neutral,"Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?"
sadness,I’m the ruptured spleen.
joy,Why would you do that?
sadness,Because you shouldn’t be with him.  You should be with me.
sadness,"When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!"
neutral,"Look, things like last night they don’t just happen."
neutral,Or at least not to me.
neutral,"Or with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know with a friend."
sadness,"I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a ""doctor…"""
neutral,"There was just one woman, wasn’t there?"
neutral,"No, there were two."

neutral,"Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn’t go out with a guy like Chandler..."
neutral,Hi there.
neutral,"...and he couldn’t let it go, and... I don’t really know what happened with that either."
neutral,"And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head."
neutral,"And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don’t know what happened there either..."
neutral,"Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler."
neutral,"Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?"

sadness,"Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out."
neutral,Sorry.
neutral,What happened?

joy,"See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!"
joy,Get out!

neutral,"Oh, thank you."
joy,That is so sweet!

anger,"No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there."
neutral,"Tell me about it, I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by myself."
neutral,It’s Joey right?
neutral,Yeah.
anger,No!
neutral,How…How small are your feet?
neutral,"Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I’m-I’m saving this for my friend Ross."
neutral,You mean Dr. Geller?
neutral,"Oh, he won’t sit here."
neutral,"Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here."
joy,"Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog."
neutral,Okay.
sadness,"Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize."

joy,I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
neutral,Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
neutral,I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
joy,I spelled out boobies.
neutral,"Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?"
neutral,"Ah, we’re out. I sold them all."

sadness,You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
sadness,Oh God!
neutral,"So, how many have you sold so far?"
joy,"Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!"
joy,"That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight."
joy,I am selling cookies by the case.
joy,They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'
neutral,"Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers....."

joy,Thread!
joy,Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
sadness,What disposable cameras?
neutral,No you didn’t.
neutral,"Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check."
neutral,"And then you said, ""Why do they call it a check?"
neutral,"Why not a Yugoslavian?"""
neutral,"Yeah, then you did that."
sadness,No. Sorry man.
neutral,"Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them."
anger,Great.

neutral,"Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries."
joy,"This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not—that’s-that’s not what it is."
neutral,"See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually."
neutral,"It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at"
neutral,Maybe in L.A?
joy,Yes!
neutral,There you go.
neutral,"So, have you kids eaten yet?"
neutral,"Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next."

anger,This game makes no sense!
joy,Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.
neutral,"Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here."
neutral,"All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card."
anger,Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.
neutral,You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
neutral,"Either, it makes no difference."
anger,"Choose, you jackass!"
neutral,I’ll take a card.
joy,"Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!"
joy,This game is kinda fun.
neutral,You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you
neutral,I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
joy,Very funny Ross!
neutral,Very life-like and funny.

anger,Oh? Really? That’s what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
fear,"No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love Rachel."
joy,"Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend."
anger,Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?
anger,Hey! I offered to marry her!
joy,Wh

neutral,"Stop with the broom, we're not making noise."
joy,We won. We won!

neutral,"Oh, he needed some time to grieve."
joy,I'm free! I'm free!
neutral,That oughta do it.
sadness,"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning."
neutral,Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
neutral,Hey.
neutral,Hey.
sadness,"Aww, is it broken?"
joy,"No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks."
neutral,Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
sadness,Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
anger,"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket."
neutral,Monica's making jam.
joy,"Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?"
neutral,Because the kids need new shoes.
neutral,I'm going into business people.
neutral,I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.

neutral,Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
neutral,I will have one.
neutral,"Okay, I’m not gonna have one."
sadness,"No, no, it’s just my tooth."
neutral,All right I’ll have one.
neutral,"So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one."
fear,"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him."
neutral,See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
anger,"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies."
joy,"That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist’s blouse."
neutral,"Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’."
sadness,"Yes, while I was in the chair!"
neutral,"That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!"
neutral,"Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist."
neutral,"It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence."
sadness,"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead."
neutral,Ross.
sadness,It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
joy,"No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called."
joy,"Ross umm, there’s something that I’ve got to tell you, there’s-there’s someone else."
sadness,Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
sadness,You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
sadness,"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here."
neutral,"So, let's go."
neutral,"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song."
neutral,"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now."
neutral,"You know, the guys are probably having a great time."
neutral,"Okay, I’ve got three of my five."
neutral,"Three of your five, what?"
neutral,Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.
neutral,"Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left."
neutral,"All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?"
joy,"Okay, Elizabeth Hurely...."
neutral,Susan Sarandon.
joy,And!! Isabella Rosselini.
joy,"Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she’s too international, y'know she’s never gonna be around."
neutral,So?
neutral,"So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time."
neutral,"Yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini, geography."
sadness,Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?
neutral,Y’know what I think it is?
neutral,I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.
sadness,Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
neutral,"Twenty-one hours, you’re a hero."
sadness,Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
neutral,"Actually, I think you’re ready to go to the delivery room."
neutral,"Ten centimeters, you’re about to become a mom."
neutral,Are they here yet?
neutral,"No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
neutral,Ok.
neutral,Hi.
neutral,May I see your boarding pass?
neutral,"Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
neutral,"Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass."
neutral,"No, I know, but I—he just went on."
sadness,"He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
anger,No no no! Federal regulations!
neutral,"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is"
neutral,Alright. What's the message?
neutral,Uh... I don't know.
neutral,"Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you."
neutral,What?
neutral,"It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back."
anger,There's no Rachel!
neutral,"Here's the thing, Janice."
neutral,"You know, I mean, it's like we're different."
anger,"I'm like the bing, bing, bing."
neutral,"You're like the boom, boom, ... boom."
anger,"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
sadness,"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back."
sadness,I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
anger,"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
neutral,"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la."
neutral,I'm fine.
neutral,All right.
fear,I'm not fine. Here she comes.
neutral,Wait here. Breathe.
neutral,It's like a gift.
neutral,We should always always break up together.
neutral,"Oh, I'd like that."
anger,You win.
neutral,"Well, what did you have?"
joy,It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six.
neutral,That my friend is D-Cup.
neutral,"Okay, now much have you won so far?"
neutral,Yeah.
joy,Double it!
neutral,"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it."
neutral,"Hey, I didn’t make up the rules."
neutral,"Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card."
neutral,"Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500."
sadness,"I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp, and I’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it."
joy,Presenting Sarah Tuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!

neutral,Yeah. Right.
joy,"Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?"

neutral,"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know?"
neutral,She lives so close.
neutral,"And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny."

anger,What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
anger,"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!"""
anger,"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea."
anger,"Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!"
sadness,I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
neutral,Is she in there?
neutral,"Yeah. She’s putting her down now, that’s her."

joy,Now get out of here you!!
anger,"Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him!"
sadness,"Look, is there something wrong with me?"
sadness,I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future?
sadness,"Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!"
sadness,"I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?"
neutral,No.
neutral,"Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank."
neutral,"So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember?"
joy,"And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass."
neutral,"Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?"
anger,You know what else I’m not gonna miss?
anger,"""I’m Monica."
anger,I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
anger,"Even if people are on it!"""
anger,"""Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!"""
anger,"""I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"""
joy,Hey! I call her!
anger,"""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"""
anger,"""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend!"
anger,"So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"""
neutral,"Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations."
neutral,"Item J437-A, color: winterberry."
neutral,"Hi umm, listen come here, come in."

joy,It’s just that I
neutral,"Listen Ross, you don’t have to apologize. I understand why you were there."
sadness,"Yeah, you still have feelings for me."
joy,"And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you."
sadness,"And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t."
sadness,"It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be."
joy,Oh God you’re right.
sadness,"Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?"
neutral,No.
neutral,"I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy."
neutral,"Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory."
neutral,"Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it."
neutral,Gimme this.
neutral,"Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t resist."
neutral,"Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin."
sadness,"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing."
joy,"I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t."
joy,Right?
joy,"I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy."
neutral,I know.  I need more pie.
neutral,"Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?"
neutral,"No, that was my way of telling you."
neutral,"Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints."
neutral,He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
neutral,"Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal."
neutral,"So then, are you going to dump Jason?"
neutral,"Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now so’s Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?"
neutral,So… It’s really just about the math.
neutral,"Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41."
anger,"Ok, look! Enough is enough!"
joy,"No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!"
neutral,"Monica, that was also true an"
anger,I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
neutral,You knew this about me when you married me!
neutral,You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
anger,"Well, this is my sickness!"
neutral,"Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster."
neutral,"Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night."
neutral,"Yeah me too, all night."
neutral,"Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don’t want to look in my hamper."
neutral,"Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone."
anger,Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
neutral,So.
neutral,So.
neutral,I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
neutral,"I mean, you know, we've never really talked."
neutral,"I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
fear,"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you."
anger,"Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't."
neutral,"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
joy,Oy.
sadness,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
neutral,"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?"
joy,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
neutral,"I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later."
neutral,"All right, Julie."
neutral,Bye.
joy,"Chandler, I found the perfect ring."
neutral,"Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first."
anger,"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!"
sadness,Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
anger,The little jail between the doors!
anger,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
anger,"I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring."
sadness,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
neutral,Maybe it was the guy.
anger,It was the ring!
neutral,"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
neutral,"Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her."
anger,"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me."
neutral,"Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment."
neutral,"Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend."
joy,"We can, we can go to Aruba!"
sadness,"When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice."
sadness,You would've liked it.
neutral,I had a bra.
neutral,"Hey, Dr. Farber."
neutral,"All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here."
fear,"I'm twelve, I'm not stupid."
neutral,Oh that's an eye removal machine.
anger,"All right, I'm outta here!"
joy,I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
anger,So were done then!
neutral,"Almost! But first, we gotta start."
neutral,This is a glaucoma test.
neutral,Uh-huh.
neutral,Sit down.
neutral,Okay.
neutral,"But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye."
anger,"A small puff of air, now come on!"
fear,"Sure, now I’m scared."
neutral,"No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday."
fear,"Yeah, but I don’t wanna die!"
joy,"No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!"
neutral,"Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert."
neutral,"Oh, hey."
neutral,Hi.
neutral,"You’ve have lipstick right here . That’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed."
neutral,No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.
neutral,"Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step."
neutral,"No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a one day job, max."
neutral,"Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s."
neutral,Power saw kinda got away from me there.
joy,Hi!
anger,Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
neutral,"So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?"
sadness,I can’t seem to say goodbye.
anger,Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
neutral,It was cheesecake.
neutral,It was fine.
joy,My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
anger,Y’know what? Forget it!
neutral,Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.
neutral,Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
neutral,"Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois."
neutral,This one’s from me.
neutral,"It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun."
neutral,Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
joy,"No! No-no, I love it. Thank you."
joy,"Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!"
neutral,Okay.
neutral,"Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys?"
neutral,For my last birthday you gave me a
neutral,Okay.
joy,Happy birthday Grandma!
neutral,It’s better to be over the hill  then buried under it.
neutral,All our love Monica and Chandler.
joy,"That’s funny, yeah!"
joy,"No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!"
sadness,"No, because you’re not a grandmother!"
sadness,"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things."
neutral,That’s why it’s so funny.
anger,All you had to do was buy the card!
neutral,"Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
neutral,Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
sadness,Sorry. Wrong boobies.
neutral,"Hello, Joey."
joy,"I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
neutral,"Hey, buddy."
neutral,"Oh, that's attractive."
joy,"Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight."
neutral,"Oh, ah- the kid has it."
anger,"The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck."
neutral,"You gotta do it, man."
anger,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever——can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck."
anger,"Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!"
anger,Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
anger,GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
anger,...Now
joy,"Oh, look, wish me luck!"
neutral,What for?
neutral,I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.
neutral,"Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?"
anger,You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
joy,Hi!
joy,I’m so glad you could make it.
joy,"Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it."
joy,Try. There’s my little girl.
neutral,She’s still mad.
joy,Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
neutral,"Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay."
joy,"Julie’s cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that’s about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself."
neutral,Have you felt Rachel’s cervix Ross?
neutral,"Well, if you like you can feel Rachel’s and then feel mine to compare."
neutral,Am I interrupting?
joy,Uh yes! Thank you.
neutral,Oh. Oh wait no.
neutral,Later.
neutral,"Oh uh, I’m sorry."
fear,No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
neutral,Try feeding her again.
neutral,I already fed her.
anger,"I know, that’s why I said again!"
fear,"Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?   That’s just what she wants."
neutral,Hey.
joy,Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
sadness,"Oh Monica, we are so sorry."
joy,For what?
sadness,"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower."
neutral,And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
neutral,"Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave."
sadness,We ruined everything.
sadness,Ugh
sadness,"Well no, wait a minute, that’s not true!"
joy,"No, what did, that was really sweet."
joy,And it kinda works out for the best.
joy,"Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!"
joy,"I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don’t even like!"
neutral,Monica.
anger,"I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!"
neutral,"Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off."
neutral,Not you guys.
joy,You got it going on!
neutral,"So, what are we gonna do today?"
neutral,They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
joy,I don't think so!
neutral,Why not?
neutral,"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
neutral,I'm not always that bad!
neutral,"Oh,"
neutral,... and...?
neutral,I clunked your heads together!
sadness,"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there."
neutral,"Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager."
neutral,Yeah.
sadness,I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire.
neutral,"Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room."
fear,All right. Did everyone get out okay?
neutral,"Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate."
fear,"No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!"
sadness,"Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!"
neutral,Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?
neutral,"Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves."
neutral,Hot dog?
fear,"Four, please.  I’m really nervous.  Thank you."
neutral,"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?"
joy,"I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific."
sadness,"Ohh, that’s too bad!"
joy,"No, I-I’m saying I liked her."
neutral,"Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."
joy,"Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again."
neutral,Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?
neutral,"Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry."
joy,"Hey, the fight’s starting!"
neutral,"Okay, we’ll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?"
anger,Nine times!
neutral,"Okay, I had to put on lotion!"
neutral,"But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free."
neutral,Fight’s over!
neutral,"Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?"
joy,Hi guys!
neutral,Hey!
neutral,What are you up too?
neutral,"Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites."
neutral,"Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you."
neutral,"Yeah, Big Brother."
neutral,Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
neutral,"Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
anger,Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
neutral,Eh
sadness,Okay well that’s good to know.
joy,The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!!
joy,"Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie business."
neutral,Y’know who I ran into from school? Howie.
neutral,My friend’s name is Joey.
neutral,Apparently Howie’s editing now.
anger,"Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie."
neutral,Refill?
joy,Hey! How you doing?
joy,"Good! Good, long time no see."
neutral,Like your sweater.
neutral,"Oh hey, right back at ya."
neutral,So whose is it?
neutral,"Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later."
neutral,Okay.
anger,He is so weird.
joy,Yeah!
joy,"You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!"
neutral,"Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet."
neutral,"Who, who are they?"
neutral,I know them from work.
neutral,"No, one of them..."
neutral,Which one?
neutral,"I don't know, what were the names I just said?"
anger,"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
sadness,"All right, all right, you're right"
anger,We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
neutral,That’s not mine.
neutral,Yes it is.
fear,How do you know?
anger,"Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!"
neutral,"Please reattach this, it’s against the law to disconnect them."
anger,Fine!  But please God.. tell me how to stop them from going off!
neutral,There’s a reset button under the plastic cover.
neutral,"Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?"
joy,Oh here it is!
joy,"Ohh, God!"
neutral,"Four letters: ""Circle or hoop""."
anger,"Ring dammit, ring!"
neutral,Thanks.
neutral,"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
anger,"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
neutral,Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
anger,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
anger,Nngghhh!!!!!!!
neutral,"Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please."
neutral,"""Heating device."""
neutral,Radiator.
neutral,Five letters.
neutral,Rdtor.
neutral,"Well, you'll have to wait your turn."
neutral,"Well, how long do you think it'll be?"
neutral,Any minute now.
joy,"Hey, this-  Heyy..."
neutral,Hey.
neutral,Hey! Any good mail?
neutral,"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild."
neutral,"Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda…."
neutral,"""Benefits lapsed."""
neutral,Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
neutral,"Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year."
neutral,All right.
anger,This sucks!
fear,"When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know?"
anger,And it wouldn’t matter.
anger,Now I gotta be careful?
sadness,"I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire."
sadness,"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent."
neutral,"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
joy,look both ways before you cross the street.
joy,"I know, it's beautiful. Amazing."
neutral,"I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."
neutral,Do you know anything about women?
neutral,No.
neutral,That's all right.
neutral,Okay.
joy,Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
joy,Yeah. He could row like a viking.
neutral,Hi.
neutral,Mmm.
neutral,So how'd it go?
neutral,"Oh, y'know.."
neutral,Did he mention us?
sadness,He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
sadness,"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere."
joy,...love you.
neutral,Are you're hands still wet?
neutral,"Uh, moist, yeah."
neutral,Let's dry 'em again.
sadness,Oh my God! Oh my God!!
neutral,Like a
neutral,"Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex."
neutral,What’s the other one?
neutral,"I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one."
neutral,"I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking."
joy,Oh that’s right.
neutral,You’re the talker.
joy,"Anyway uh, great idea!"
neutral,"Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues."
neutral,"Oh, we have some"
anger,No you don’t!
neutral,"Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up."
neutral,"Yeah, what town are we near?"
neutral,"Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?"
anger,Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?
neutral,"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
neutral,"Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?"
sadness,"I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here."
neutral,"Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?"
neutral,Okay!
neutral,"Yeah, no they don’t do that."
neutral,"Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us."
anger,Who?
fear,I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
neutral,"I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up."
anger,"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!"
fear,But if...
anger,"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else."
joy,"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back."
neutral,So the going for help went well?
neutral,"I’m telling you man, I saw it."
anger,"Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong."
sadness,"I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?"
neutral,I know.
neutral,Let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment.
joy,"Okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come."
anger,"I mean this picture is supposed to say ""Geller and Bing to be married,"" not ""Local woman saves drowning moron!"""
anger,Hey!
anger,Don’t laugh at him!
neutral,He’s
joy,We’re gonna find love!
joy,Definitely!
neutral,"Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that."
joy,That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
neutral,It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
neutral,What do you mean?
neutral,"Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other."
neutral,You mean a backup?
joy,Exactly!
neutral,"Yeah, yeah I got that."
neutral,You do?
neutral,Hm-mmm
neutral,Who?
joy,Yeah!
joy,"Yeah, I locked him years ago!"
neutral,"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal."
neutral,"Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?"
neutral,"Yeah, I’m sorry man.  You wanna go watch?"
joy,Yeah!
neutral,Good morning.
joy,"Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?"
joy,Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
joy,Ohh that’s nice.
joy,Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
neutral,"Well kinda old, like 30."
neutral,Oh.
neutral,A little.
neutral,How you doin’?
joy,"Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!"
neutral,I know.
joy,So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
joy,You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
joy,Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
joy,I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
joy,"Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!"
neutral,What do you say?
joy,Okay!
joy,Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
anger,Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
neutral,It went under the table.
anger,"Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!"
joy,Here it is! Here it is!
neutral,That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
neutral,It's a four.
neutral,I think so too.
joy,Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.
joy,"Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you."
neutral,"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now."
neutral,Is there anything we can do for you?
neutral,"No just, nobody press on my stomach."
neutral,You can keep those pants by the way.
neutral,"Yeah, you want some?"
joy,"Ah, just cut me a little sliver."
neutral,A little bigger.
neutral,Little bigger.
anger,Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?!
anger,Cut me a real piece!
neutral,"I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler."
neutral,"Of course, of course."
neutral,"Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?"
neutral,"Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns?"
fear,Why don’t you…   Wh-what’s going on?
neutral,"Well, umm, not much."
neutral,"But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know?"
neutral,"So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?"
neutral,"Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?"
neutral,Nothing..Why?
anger,"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!"
neutral,Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
anger,Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
neutral,"Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?"
sadness,"Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this."
fear,"Okay,  I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you."
sadness,"Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart."
sadness,"Your good heart Rach,  and, and...."
neutral,No.
sadness,"I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now."
sadness,"I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever."
sadness,"God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t,  it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross."
sadness,"It’s just changed, everything."
sadness,Forever.
sadness,"Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean."
sadness,Then how come it is?
neutral,"Windows are clean, candels are lit."
joy,"Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt."
neutral,Did I turn the fish?
neutral,"No, cause I made lasagne."
anger,Am I out of control?
neutral,Just a touch.
neutral,"Mon, I don't understand."
neutral,What?
joy,Could tonight be the Night?
neutral,I don't know.
joy,Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.
joy,"Things happen, and they happen."
neutral,You don't plan these things.
neutral,"So, did you shave your legs?"
neutral,Yeah.
anger,Ross!
neutral,"Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up."
joy,Hi!
neutral,"Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready."
fear,Uh-oh.
neutral,Is there a problem?
neutral,"Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato."
neutral,"But that's okay, no problem."
neutral,No problem.
neutral,"Hmm, noodle soup."
neutral,"Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, ""Hmm, soup."""
neutral,"Hmm, noodle soup."
neutral,"All right, let's try one."
neutral,"Hmm, noodle soup."
neutral,Okay. Let's do it again.
neutral,Okay.
anger,"Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!"
anger,COME ON!!!!
anger,Y'know what? We need to move on.
anger,"No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!"
neutral,Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
neutral,Yeah?
neutral,Give her some money.
neutral,I really think they’re out of rooms.
anger,"They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!"
neutral,"Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble, you don’t know where any countries are."
neutral,Okay.
neutral,"Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?"
neutral,This is a hospital.
neutral,Y’know what?
anger,I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone.
anger,And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa!
neutral,Would you like to see a semi-private room?
neutral,"Yeah, it couldn’t hurt to look."
neutral,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
joy,That's funny. Who are they?
neutral,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend."
neutral,If you wanna put a label on it.
sadness,"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this."
neutral,"Okay, quick and painful."
fear,"Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me."
neutral,Y'know Marcel?
neutral,...Yeah?
sadness,"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him."
joy,Hi Pheebs!
joy,Hi!
neutral,How are ya?
neutral,Good.
neutral,"Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?"
neutral,Yeah.
neutral,And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
joy,Yeah!
anger,And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
fear,"Ooh, now you lost me."
anger,You stole the phone!
anger,No I didn’t!
anger,"No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?"
fear,"No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!"
anger,Phoebe!
neutral,It’s not here.
neutral,"Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?"
neutral,How could I have left them in the copy room?
anger,I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.
anger,Fine.
joy,How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
neutral,This will be your phone.
neutral,"That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls."
neutral,No you answer it and take pledges.
neutral,"No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones."
neutral,"You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray."
neutral,"Well, here's your phone doctor."
neutral,Hey guys.
neutral,"Well, he’s very charming."
neutral,"Well, you’re just gonna have to try."
neutral,"Joey, where are the"
neutral,"I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em around..."
anger,"Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go."
joy,Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
joy,My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
joy,I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.
sadness,"Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots."
anger,Come on more!
joy,Oh God!
neutral,"Yeah, you like that don’t you?"
joy,Oh yeah right there!
joy,You want it there? You take it there baby!
sadness,Uh Phoebe?
joy,"Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now I’m going to cover you back up, and umm we’re never doing this again."
anger,Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?
anger,"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be!"
neutral,Huh?
anger,Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out!
neutral,I talk to you and it’s nothin’.
neutral,"You look at me, and nothin’."
neutral,Nothing.
joy,"You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we’re gonna pick it up here, tomorrow."
neutral,"Well, that was ah..."
anger,Do you know what just happened?
neutral,Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
neutral,No. We were in the middle of sex…and
joy,"Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!"
neutral,"Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States."
neutral,Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.

neutral,"I had such an opportunity in the recent, present."
sadness,"And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually."
anger,"Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him."
sadness,"And now, he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV."

neutral,"Well, they go into the chipper."
fear,"Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!"

neutral,Aren’t you with that girl over there?
neutral,"Well, yeah, kinda."

anger,It’s laminated!
neutral,"Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local."
neutral,Y'know it’s ironic...
neutral,...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
neutral,We’re just gonna be friends.
anger,Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get!
joy,Hey Pheebs!
neutral,"Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long."
joy,"Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love."

neutral,"Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!"
neutral,"Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married?"
anger,Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!
anger,Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
neutral,So that’s the only reason she could be here huh?
neutral,It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a
anger,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!"
neutral,"I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later."
neutral,Good-bye.
neutral,"Uh, that was your sister actually."

neutral,"I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays."
neutral,"Umm, okay, okay, look."
anger,I took this picture from your fridge.
anger,"Okay, because I know that this is my Father."
anger,"Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him."
anger,"Now, look I deserve to know where I came from."
anger,All right?
anger,So if you can help me find my Father then you should!
anger,"Otherwise, you’re just mean!"
anger,"So, just tell me the truth!"
neutral,"All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni."
neutral,"No, no, that’s just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!"
sadness,"And I’m very sorry, but I don’t know where your Father is, and that’s the truth."
sadness,Oh.
neutral,"But umm, you’re right."
neutral,I think that a person should know where they come from.
neutral,"Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay."
neutral,I’m your mother.
sadness,"Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and..."

anger,"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression."
sadness,"Obviously, I screwed up."
neutral,But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here.
neutral,So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
anger,Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am
neutral,"Where you going, Joe?"
neutral,For a walk.
neutral,Oh. You mind if I join you?
neutral,"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts."
joy,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!"
neutral,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
anger,Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??
sadness,You guys are killing me!
sadness,She's forbidden fruit!
sadness,"It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?"
neutral,Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
neutral,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
anger,Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
neutral,Fine ... mediocre porn
neutral,"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office."
neutral,"Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk."
sadness,That’s kinda sad.
neutral,"Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,"
joy,Got it!
joy,Let’s roll!
neutral,"Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?"

anger,"Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?"
neutral,"I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?"
neutral,"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
neutral,"Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school."
neutral,"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket."
sadness,I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
neutral,It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
joy,And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
neutral,I-I owe her this.

anger,"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!"
sadness,"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions."
sadness,"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died."
neutral,"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
joy,"Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!"

neutral,"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion."
neutral,Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
anger,"Walls are pretty thin, guys!"
joy,"Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids."
neutral,"We’re actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we’re not looking for applicants right now."
sadness,"Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?"
neutral,"Well, here’s a schedule of what’s coming up."

neutral,Okay.
joy,"Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember? No crumbies!"
neutral,"Okay, I’ll be out in a second."
neutral,Okay!

neutral,"Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped."
neutral,"Me too, we should get goin'."
neutral,No.
neutral,"Okay, here comes another camera."
neutral,Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
neutral,Why do they keep doing that?
neutral,"If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms."
neutral,They’ve been taping those people up there all day.
neutral,Right.
joy,"Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?"
joy,Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?

neutral,"Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description."
neutral,Oh.

neutral,"Ummmmmmmm, no."
anger,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!
sadness,"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea."

neutral,"Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?"
anger,Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
neutral,"Come on, they're close."
neutral,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."

joy,Saucy!
neutral,What are these?
neutral,Electrical plans for the building.
fear,"Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?"
neutral,"I know that switch does something, okay?"

neutral,Oh fine.
joy,Ready?  Wrestle!
neutral,"Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks."
neutral,"All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area."
fear,"Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!"
anger,I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
neutral,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke."

anger,It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!
joy,Say it!
anger,"Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!"
neutral,"Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine."
neutral,"Yeah, it's in there."
neutral,"Joey, can I talk to you for a second?"
neutral,Yes. Yes.
joy,"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
neutral,It happened in London.
neutral,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
fear,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
fear,"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell."
joy,"I know, it's great!"
sadness,We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
neutral,"And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb."
neutral,"Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?"
neutral,"No Cobb, as in cobb salad."
neutral,"Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?"

neutral,"All right, call it in the air."
neutral,Heads.
neutral,Heads it is.
joy,Yes! Whew!
neutral,We have to assign heads to something.
neutral,"Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads."
anger,What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
neutral,"Okay, some tricks of the trade."
neutral,"Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling."
neutral,"Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil."
neutral,"That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’  Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13."
neutral,And that’s how it’s done.
joy,"Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
neutral,"Hey, Mr. Trib."
joy,Hey-hey.

joy,"Well, I’m going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh!"
joy,"Oh, hey guys!"
neutral,"Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden."
neutral,"Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter."
neutral,Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas?
neutral,Didn’t think so!
neutral,"Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!"
anger,"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?"
neutral,"Hmm, how about my azzz?"

neutral,"Alright, no, we could look at them!"
neutral,I
joy,"Hi! I’m so glad you’re here, but it’s gonna be a while. I-I wished you’d called first."
neutral,"Oh that’s all right, I’m coming back later with your father."
joy,Oh good.
neutral,I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
neutral,"Okay, what’s up?"
neutral,"I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it."
joy,"This is your grandmother’s engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel."
fear,Just hear me out!
sadness,"Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus."
sadness,I can’t believe this!
sadness,"I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross."
sadness,"You’re, you’re really, you’re so good."
sadness,Thanks.
neutral,And you’re so sweet.  And you’re kind
sadness,Thanks.
neutral,"Okay, it’s okay."
joy,"Wait, wait, wait."
sadness,My foot is stuck in the pocket.
sadness,"No, I can’t get it out."
neutral,Rachel?
joy,"Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job."
joy,Yes.
joy,Congratulations...oh..wow
anger,I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!
sadness,"Oh, stop beating yourself up!"
neutral,People make mistakes!
neutral,These things happen!
neutral,There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there?
anger,Apparently you’re not very good at it!
neutral,I
neutral,Philadelphia.
neutral,"Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm."
joy,Yeah.
sadness,"But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!"
neutral,Did you hear that?!
anger,I don’t need you guys to care about me!
joy,Because the universe cares!
joy,The whole universe!
sadness,I really wished they’d care just a little bit though.
joy,"I like this one.  It seems to say, ""I love you and that’s why I have to kill you."""
joy,"They can’t all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is."
joy,I’m having a really good time!
sadness,Me too! I’m sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
neutral,"Ohh. No that’s okay, he’s a friend."
fear,"Hey uh, I don’t mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?"
sadness,"Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost."
neutral,"Okay, don’t freak out. I’ll go."
anger,"No it’s… Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!"
neutral,"Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross?"
neutral,Yeah?
neutral,"Yeah, umm that’s Whitney , Kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?"
neutral,Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
neutral,"Look, I don’t think so Pheebs.  All right, I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend."
neutral,"Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?"
neutral,I'll take sports.
neutral,Mine!
neutral,"All right. Uhh, international."
neutral,"Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say"
anger,Ross! Janice?!
neutral,"All right, hold on!"
neutral,Hold on.
neutral,Hold on.
neutral,"This is Ross, okay?"
neutral,He's our friend.
anger,He obviously went crazy.
anger,He obviously lost his mind.
neutral,So are you actually gonna see her again?
anger,Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
anger,Damnit Phoebe!!
neutral,"Hey, don’t we have to..."
neutral,"Yeah, we got, um-hmm."
joy,"Umm, I think you’re really, really great..."
sadness,Oh God!
sadness,Here we go again.
anger,Why does this keep happening to me?
sadness,Is it something I’m putting out there?
sadness,Is this my fault?
sadness,Or am I just nuts?
sadness,Wait!
sadness,Terry!
sadness,Please!
sadness,"Look, I just lost my other job."
neutral,Okay?
sadness,You have no idea how much I need this.
sadness,"Please, help me out, for old times sake."
sadness,This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.
joy,"It’s not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramoray’s a miracle worker. Look, here he comes."
neutral,"Good morning.  Drake, it’s your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?"
joy,I’m back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
anger,That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
neutral,Well you did pull his hair.
anger,He took my snack!
anger,I’m not getting into this again!
sadness,"Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad."
anger,"Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay."
fear,"This doesn’t mean anything, does it?"
anger,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?
neutral,That is true.
neutral,"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun."
neutral,"Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche."
neutral,"Joey, you know you don’t actually have one."
sadness,Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!
anger,"Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me."
neutral,"All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room."
anger,"What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!"
neutral,"The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!"
anger,But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!
fear,"He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital."
neutral,"But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years."
neutral,I think that’s gum.
neutral,I’m pretty sure it’s gun.
anger,"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go."
anger,"A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?"
neutral,That was the only way I could get him to
neutral,Hi! How are the Gellers?
anger,Don’t call us that!
anger,The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
anger,Hey! It’s Porsche!!
joy,Hey sweetie!
joy,Hey!
neutral,"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know?"
neutral,"Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside."
joy,"Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you."
neutral,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
joy,Stop it!
neutral,"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this."
neutral,"I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here."
neutral,Yeah?
joy,Of course he is!
joy,"What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse?"
anger,What kind of father do you think I am?
neutral,"All right, sorry."
neutral,I gotta go make a fake Ben.
neutral,"Well, either that or uh"
anger,Joey!!
neutral,Yeah?
anger,Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
anger,"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!"
joy,"Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!"
joy,They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!!
neutral,"Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it."
joy,Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
anger,Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a
neutral,Sure!
neutral,"Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it."
neutral,"I mean, everyone should have a-a"
joy,You like it?
neutral,I
neutral,Yeah?
neutral,Hello darlings.
joy,And there’s daddy!
neutral,Where?
joy,Right- where we've been looking all night!
joy,He is so cute!
joy,"Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"
joy,"Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the——wowww."
joy,"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
joy,"Yeah, isn't he?"
joy,"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight."
joy,You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
neutral,Huh. That's nice.
neutral,"and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for"
neutral,Eight whole days.
joy,"That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end."
joy,Awesome!
neutral,My favorite part was when
neutral,The Armadillo was actually not so
joy,Hey!
neutral,Oh.
joy,"Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!"
neutral,Oh.
neutral,Oh.
neutral,"Okay, I understand why"
joy,"Yeah, sure. Good luck!"
joy,I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo!  I’m okay!! I’m all right!!
neutral,What?
neutral,Why would you say that?
neutral,‘Cause you’re still into Monica.
neutral,"So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and..."
joy,You’re good. You’re good!
neutral,"Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift."
fear,"Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?"
neutral,"Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?"
neutral,Thanks a lot.
neutral,"No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks."
neutral,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi."
anger,"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!"
neutral,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
joy,"Oh, thanks, sweetie."
joy,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
fear,You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
neutral,"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
neutral,Can't wait.
neutral,"Good, good, I'm a lawyer now."
joy,"Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage."
neutral,"Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band."
neutral,Ross.
neutral,Chandler.
neutral,"Look, you guys wanna meet the group?"
neutral,Come on.
anger,"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease."
neutral,"The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
neutral,"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you."
joy,"Hey, buddy, what's up!"
neutral,"Well, yeah, I have one now and then."
neutral,"Well, yeah, now."
neutral,"Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before."
joy,"Well, okay, thanks!"
joy,"God, he's good."
neutral,If only he were a woman.
neutral,Yeah.
neutral,The last candle's about to burn out.
neutral,"10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48...."
neutral,Thank you.
neutral,Thanks.
fear,Kinda... spooky without any lights.
joy,Bwah-hah-hah!
joy,"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..."
neutral,Oh.. oh... oh.
neutral,"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica."
neutral,"All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?"
joy,You blew them away!
joy,"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!"
neutral,"I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?"
joy,"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!"
joy,I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
joy,"Look, I took it too far!"
neutral,"Okay, Monica: Right foot red."
neutral,Could've played
neutral,Thanks.
neutral,"Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good."
neutral,"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the"
neutral,"Oh, okay. Will you take my place?"
neutral,"Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel."
neutral,Hello?
neutral,"Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much."
joy,"Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really."
neutral,Green. To the green.
neutral,I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.
neutral,"To the left, to the left- aww!"
neutral,Ohhh... I'm fine.
joy,Hey!
fear,Please tell me you got the message!
neutral,What message?
neutral,"The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock."
fear,"Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!"
anger,"I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!"
neutral,I went to Ross’s!
neutral,I went to the coffeehouse!
neutral,I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
neutral,"That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day."
neutral,That’s what you think.
neutral,"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?"
neutral,"Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse."
neutral,What was her name?
neutral,Nestley Toulouse.
neutral,Nestlé Toll House?
neutral,"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language."
anger,I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
anger,I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  you’re burning in hell!!
neutral,"So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?"
joy,Absolutely!
joy,I am so on board!
neutral,Rachel didn't you just light that?
neutral,"Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach."
neutral,I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
neutral,Tell me about it!
joy,Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
neutral,It does sound appealing.
joy,"Oh, I never could do it."
neutral,Oh but you could.
neutral,You can.
joy,Absolutely!
joy,We can help each other out!
neutral,We can get--what are those--those patches!
joy,We could be like the Patch Sisters!
joy,"Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!"
joy,Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
sadness,My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.
joy,Okay then!
neutral,"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
neutral,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
anger,"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!"
anger,"Hey, this is so unfair!"
anger,So I have a flaw!
anger,Big deal!
anger,Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
anger,"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?"
anger,"And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?"
anger,"...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
anger,...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
neutral,"Well, I-I could live without it."
neutral,"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?"
neutral,"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
anger,"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?"
neutral,"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
joy,"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work."
neutral,"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
anger,"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on."
sadness,Awww! Mel Torme died.
neutral,"Joey, that paper’s like a year old!"
sadness,Aw! Does that mean the
neutral,Hey.
neutral,Hey.
neutral,You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
neutral,"Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does."
neutral,Probably?
neutral,Kind of what ‘probably’ really means.
neutral,"Yeah, uh-huh."
anger,"Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y’know?"
anger,"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"""
neutral,You gotta take care of yourselves!
neutral,In
neutral,"Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?"
joy,Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
joy,Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?
neutral,He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?
neutral,"Oh, I’m fine."
neutral,"Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her all alone."
neutral,"Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross."
neutral,"Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?"
neutral,"Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!"
neutral,"I’m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they’re gonna be there until they start their real family."
sadness,Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.
neutral,"And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here."
neutral,Hey. Who’s that?
neutral,New people.
anger,They’re having their baby!
anger,It’s not fair Ross we got here first!
neutral,Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.
neutral,Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
neutral,Phoebe?
neutral,Yeah?
neutral,"He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed."
sadness,"Oh, what is wrong with me lately?"
neutral,I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here.
neutral,"Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack."
neutral,"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?"
neutral,Yeah.
neutral,"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy."
neutral,Oh absolutely yeah!
neutral,"Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy."
joy,"Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap."
neutral,"Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a"
fear,I don’t know what I’m going to do!
anger,I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care!
anger,"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?"
joy,Hey guys!
joy,Hey!
neutral,Hey
joy,"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!"
joy,And the guys from work had a blast.
joy,"Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before."
joy,Yeah!
joy,"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!"
joy,"Yeah, right!"
neutral,"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those"
joy,"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life."
joy,"So you might say, it’s a magic ring."
neutral,Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
neutral,"Obviously! So, how do we decide?"
neutral,"Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her"
neutral,Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
joy,"That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her"
neutral,Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
neutral,"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while."
neutral,Yeah well we should order some food then.
neutral,"No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll"
neutral,That sounds fair.
neutral,Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
anger,Ah yeah—wait a second now!
neutral,Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
anger,I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
neutral,"Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates."
neutral,"All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates."
neutral,So let’s decide on the spending limit
neutral,"Yeah. Uh, …a slice……six dollars?"
neutral,I was thinking more like a hundred.
neutral,Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
neutral,"Hi, again."
neutral,Hey!
neutral,Hey!
joy,"Thank you soo, much."
anger,"Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work."
neutral,You want some help with that?
neutral,"Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I don’t!"
neutral,It’s the heat.  And-and the humidity.
neutral,"That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination."
neutral,Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
neutral,What do you mean?
neutral,Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
neutral,"Hey, somebody left their keys."
neutral,"Hey Gunther, these yours?"
neutral,Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
neutral,"Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?"
neutral,"Well, I didn’t realize until I got home."
neutral,I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
neutral,I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield.
neutral,"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe."
joy,Great! Thanks.
neutral,"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep."
joy,"Carol, we've been through this before, ok?"
joy,We have a good time.
joy,"We laugh, we play."
joy,It's like we're father and son.
joy,"Oh, this is so cute."
neutral,"Oh, I got that for him."
joy,My mommies love me. That's clever.
neutral,Hello?
neutral,"Oh, Hi, Ju——Hi, Jew!"
neutral,Uh huh?
neutral,Uh huh?
neutral,"Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great."
neutral,See ya then.
neutral,Bye.
neutral,"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith."
joy,Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!
joy,Thanks Monica!
neutral,"Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it."
joy,"I can smell it a little, bake the pie."
joy,Okay!
neutral,Okay.
neutral,"Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector."
neutral,"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire."
neutral,"No-no, it was the candles."
neutral,It’s very not good leaving candles unattended.
neutral,"In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is…  Uhh… Uhh… Okay."
neutral,"Well, I have to go now."
fear,"Well, I-I said yes."
anger,Are you crazy?
anger,You just had Ross’s baby!
anger,It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.
neutral,I know.
sadness,You can’t marry him!
sadness,Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.
neutral,Well do you love him?
neutral,Sure.
neutral,Sure?
neutral,"Yeah, I mean whatever."
sadness,"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?"
sadness,"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?"
neutral,So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
joy,Here comes the bride.
joy,I wanna wear this everyday.
joy,You look so beautiful.
joy,I’m so happy for me.
neutral,Hello?
fear,Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
neutral,"Yeah, we got him back. Everything’s fine."
anger,Damnit!
anger,"I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?"
neutral,Fine.
anger,"Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel."
anger,And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!
neutral,"No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I"
sadness,"Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff!"
neutral,And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!
anger,Crap!!
neutral,I gotta go!
neutral,No.
neutral,Just act like you belong.
neutral,Shh!  Nice to see you again.
neutral,"Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?"
neutral,"Yes, of course."
neutral,"I’m sorry, would you move your thumb? I can’t see the seat number."
neutral,"Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A."
joy,Okay!
neutral,Y’know what?
joy,I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
neutral,All I really needed was a plan.
neutral,See I wanna have three kids
joy,"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother."
neutral,As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years.
joy,You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!
anger,"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,"
anger,Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!
anger,Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
neutral,I don’t know.
anger,Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!
neutral,I don’t think you have much choice.
anger,Well we’ll see!
neutral,Bye-bye!
neutral,Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
neutral,Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
neutral,Dad?
neutral,I’m here!
joy,"Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work."
sadness,"Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house."
neutral,"Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling."
neutral,Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
sadness,I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore.
joy,"Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories"
neutral,"Well, I don’t know what’s in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven"
neutral,I used to
neutral,"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater."
neutral,"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a"
neutral,"Ok, got the vent open."
joy,"Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!"
neutral,"Ben, you ready?"
neutral,"All right, gimme your foot."
neutral,"Ok, on three, Ben."
neutral,"One, two, three."
neutral,"Ok, That's it, Ben."
neutral,What do you see?
neutral,"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent."
joy,"You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system."
joy,Thank you.
neutral,Filing system?
neutral,You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
joy,It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
neutral,"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that."
neutral,I notice that you’ve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
joy,"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me."
joy,Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It’s amazing how she gets it right almost
neutral,"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that."
joy,"Oh yes, well there’s the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!"
neutral,"Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers."
neutral,"Yes, I realize that"
neutral,"And Rachel shouldn’t have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean."
joy,I love working with designers!
neutral,"With them, under them, what’s the difference? Eh, Rach?"
neutral,"Chandler, you have an assistant right?"
fear,Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
neutral,"Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile."
neutral,"Yeah!  All right, maybe you don’t have to smile. Let’s try something else. Let’s try umm, try looking sexy."
neutral,Okay.
neutral,Or not.
neutral,Where's Chandler?
neutral,Here I am.
neutral,"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!"
neutral,"Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically..."
neutral,"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar"
anger,"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""
neutral,"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?"
neutral,"So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing."
joy,"Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls."
anger,"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
joy,"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard"
anger,"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
neutral,"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
neutral,"So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?"
joy,Of course I am!
neutral,"Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot."
neutral,"I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes."
neutral,And-and then guess what?
sadness,The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do.
sadness,"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?"
neutral,"No. Sweetie, you’re gonna be fine."
fear,Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
neutral,I’m going to the bathroom.

joy,Hey!
neutral,I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
neutral,Not if you were here.
neutral,"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor."
joy,Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope it’s you!
neutral,I hope it’s you.
joy,Me too!
joy,"First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me"
joy,"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!"
neutral,"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other."
neutral,"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine"
joy,Yes!!! Oh!!
anger,Hypothetically!
neutral,Still.
neutral,If Phoebe were my maid of honor
neutral,"Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset."
neutral,Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.
neutral,"Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?"
neutral,"Well that’s the best part. Umm,"
joy,Because then I don’t have to!
neutral,Well of
joy,I’m really not deciding!
anger,Fine!
joy,"Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!"
neutral,"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?"
neutral,It's not just the drum noise.
anger,"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!"
anger,"Oh god, my eye!"""
anger,"I mean, it is so annoying."
neutral,"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums."
neutral,Maybe on some level.
neutral,"No, I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you."
joy,"Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they’re my favorite. Thank you."
joy,"And, a brownie!"
neutral,"Well, half a brownie."

neutral,"Hey come on now, this is a real date."
neutral,"Uh, so…nice place you got here."
neutral,Pizza box.
neutral,"Yeah, actually that’s my roommate’s."
neutral,I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
neutral,"Ah yes, but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch yourself."
joy,"Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?"
neutral,Hm-mmm
neutral,"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?"
neutral,"Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay."
anger,"No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!"
anger,Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
neutral,"Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive."
joy,"Ha. Ha, ha."

joy,"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!"
neutral,"Oh please, could she"
neutral,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
neutral,"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys."
joy,You could do that!
neutral,"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
neutral,OK.
joy,"This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?"
neutral,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
neutral,"Last time I do that, I promise."

neutral,"Okay, it’ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos."
neutral,"Um-hmm, five actually."
neutral,"Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?"
neutral,We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
neutral,"Hey, y’know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?"
neutral,"Sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine."
neutral,"Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right."
neutral,"Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right."

joy,I'm- I'm Monana!
neutral,"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people."
joy,Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
neutral,What?
sadness,They've arrested Monica.
neutral,Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
neutral,"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
neutral,"No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"
neutral,"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y."
neutral,I just...
neutral,I wrote that out phonetically for you.
neutral,Phonetically?
neutral,"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this."
joy,"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days""    I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."
neutral,"But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear""."
neutral,Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
neutral,"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! ."
anger,"Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't"
neutral,Come on! you...

joy,"I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!"
joy,"And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!"
neutral,"So umm, does it?"
sadness,I’m sorry.
fear,Does it?
neutral,"Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance."
anger,"What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!"
anger,"Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even"
neutral,"No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t"
joy,Are you sure?
joy,"Oh, sure! I’m sure."
neutral,You got married again.
neutral,Yes.
neutral,So that’s your second marriage in two years.

neutral,"But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game."
neutral,"Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed."
neutral,"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
neutral,"That's alright, I'll take it."
neutral,Bad things happen to me anyway.
neutral,This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
neutral,"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen..."
neutral,You wanna do it right now?
joy,Great!
neutral,"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from"

neutral,"And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker."
neutral,"You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city."
neutral,"Okay, Chandler!"

joy,"Oh, well thank you in advance."
neutral,Hey guys!

joy,Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
joy,Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
neutral,"No! Joey, you’re going to be great!"
fear,"But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything about technology!"

anger,I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.
neutral,I’ll be waiting.
joy,"Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?"
joy,"Now look, there’s only one problem though."
neutral,"There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s."
sadness,"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here."
neutral,"Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident."

anger,"See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it."

neutral,"And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too."
neutral,And now I have seen her naked.
neutral,"I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something."
neutral,"But there are no boles, she’s smooth!"
neutral,Smooth!
joy,Yep. Pretty much.
neutral,"You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!"
neutral,"You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!"
neutral,"Yeah, most of it it's a place"
neutral,"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."
neutral,"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison    Avenue."

sadness,"Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section"

sadness,"Well, she’ll understand right? It’s not like I did it on purpose."
neutral,"Dad, that won’t matter to her."
anger,"Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff!"
anger,"See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her."
sadness,"Well, can you blame her?"
joy,"Well I don’t know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could"
sadness,"Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it."

neutral,Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it
neutral,"Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you."

neutral,Hey.
neutral,"Hey, man. What's up?"
neutral,Maybe you can tell me.
anger,My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today.
neutral,The first good thing she gets me in weeks.
anger,How could you not give me the message?
anger,"Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
anger,"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!"
neutral,"See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed."

neutral,G.I. Joe
joy,"Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!"
sadness,"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid."
neutral,"I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers."

neutral,"But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary."
neutral,I am

neutral,"Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover."
joy,That’s great. Good for you guys.
anger,I am not high maintenance!
anger,I am not a pushover!
neutral,Who said you were?
anger,You did!
neutral,"Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything."
joy,"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."
neutral,That does not sound stupid to me.
neutral,"You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?"
sadness,"I'm sorry, that's all the time we have."
neutral,Next on Ross... Uh-oh.

anger,"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
anger,Do not speak ill of the dead.
anger,"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?"
sadness,"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom."
anger,What did you say?

neutral,"Oh, Rachel."
joy,Hey!
joy,Hey!
neutral,"Oh, is the play over?"

neutral,"Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should."
neutral,"You should, you should ask Rachel to help."
neutral,Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.
joy,"Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk."
neutral,"Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff."
joy,"Y’know what? I don’t, I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come."
joy,No! I do want to!
neutral,"Oh, she does want to."
neutral,She does want to.
joy,Yeah!
sadness,These old things.

neutral,"You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion."

joy,"Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on."
joy,"Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have them take you home, so… Oh!"
neutral,"And also, umm next time you see me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen."
neutral,Ready?
sadness,Uh-huh.  Good luck.
neutral,Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
sadness,"Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so"
neutral,I'm not your brother.
anger,What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!
neutral,Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.

sadness,"Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?"
sadness,How can I accept that...
sadness,I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
joy,Kiss me.
joy,"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?"
neutral,The bigger half.
joy,I'd like to propose a toast.
joy,"Little toast here, ding ding."
joy,"I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting."
anger,"Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?"
joy,So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
joy,That's so sweet.
joy,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
joy,And a crappy New Year.
joy,"Here, here!"
anger,"Now, hold on!"

anger,She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all!
sadness,That’s all!
anger,Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else.
sadness,"Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that."
anger,"All right, I’ll tell her.  Come on bugger face!"

neutral,We fell asleep! That is all.
neutral,"Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go."
neutral,I think that would be best.

anger,Okay. But not about this!
anger,No! Never! Never!  Bye.
neutral,No touch! No touch!
sadness,"Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa."
neutral,"It’s a funny story, actually."
neutral,"I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really  know what I was saying."
fear,"But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny?"
neutral,"Not a fan, alright ."
neutral,"See, here’s  the thing."
neutral,I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go.
joy,"See, me, I  love Tulsa!"
joy,Tulsa is heaven!

neutral,"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
neutral,Oh. Thanks.
joy,"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing"
neutral,"Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'."
sadness,"I mean, what am I gonna do without you?"
sadness,Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?
sadness,Who's gonna take me to the
neutral,What do you mean?
neutral,Smell familiar?
fear,Oh no.
sadness,"Oh, I am so sorry."
sadness,"No me, I am so sorry..."
fear,"Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot."
fear,"Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun."
neutral,"Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles."
neutral,Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
neutral,"My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally."
neutral,"No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now."
neutral,Tho?
fear,Ohhh.
neutral,"That's good, have a seat."
neutral,"Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle."
neutral,"You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?"
neutral,Can you do that for me?
neutral,Ok.
neutral,Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
fear,Yes!
neutral,"All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard."
anger,"Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!"
anger,Let go of my hand!
joy,You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
joy,Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
neutral,Well…let’s just say
joy,"Oo, where are the seats?"
neutral,"Uh, middle balcony."
anger,You’re a mean old woman.
sadness,No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook!
joy,It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
joy,"You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity!"
joy,That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
anger,That means nothing to me.  Come on!
fear,"Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger."
neutral,: What are you doing?
joy,Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry.  It’s a little old but
anger,: No! You’re clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
sadness,I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.
anger,": Oh yeah, of course you don’t!"
anger,": You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?"
anger,"Well, why don’t think of someone else for a change?"
sadness,"Okay, I’m sorry."
joy,Hello!
neutral,What's this?
neutral,Oh right its that girl's phone number.
joy,"Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me."
joy,"Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!"
anger,"Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it."
neutral,Thank you.
joy,"I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!"
joy,Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift!
neutral,Yeah. What is that?
sadness,"Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami."
sadness,Hey! How’d it go?
neutral,Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
sadness,Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
joy,"I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you."
neutral,So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
neutral,"No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight."
joy,"Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this."
fear,Listen I uh…  It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom.
neutral,"Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond."
joy,"So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?"
neutral,Thank you.
anger,If I can’t have it you can’t have it!
neutral,"Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget."
neutral,"There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and"
neutral,Paris?
neutral,We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
neutral,Keep talking.
joy,"Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can!"
joy,I love you!
joy,Yes!

neutral,"I am sorry, but some of us have to"
sadness,"Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning."
neutral,"Well okay, I’ll swing by later. Do you live in this building?"
neutral,Um-hmm.
neutral,Mm! Night Gar’!
joy,Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy’s hammered!
neutral,"I’m sorry Joey, as long as he’s here and he’s conscious we’re still shooting."
neutral,You wouldn’t happen to have a very big fork?
neutral,"So I uh, I just talked to the director. That’s it, we’re done for the day."

neutral,"I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture."
neutral,"Okay, but there"
anger,I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!
neutral,I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
sadness,And did you?!
neutral,"No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs."
neutral,But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
neutral,Hello darling.
neutral,"Hello, Mrs. Chatracus."
neutral,"Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna"

joy,"I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd."
neutral,Listen.
neutral,"As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing."
neutral,"I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you."
sadness,"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked."
neutral,"Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.."
neutral,"Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye."
neutral,Hey sweetie.
neutral,"Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?"
neutral,I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.

joy,I know!!
fear,God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?
joy,Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
neutral,They have the best stuff in there.
anger,"Comin' through. Move, move."
joy,"Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine."
anger,But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
anger,"Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds."
anger,"No suds, no save. Ok?"
neutral,What's goin' on?
neutral,Was your basket on top?
neutral,"Yeah, but, there were no suds."
neutral,So?
neutral,"Well, you know, no suds, no save."
anger,"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine."
neutral,"Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it."
anger,"Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it."
anger,Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
joy,"Well, I think this is a great place to work!"
anger,"Ok, are they listening?"
joy,Varrrrrroom!
joy,Hey!
anger,Watch it lady!
joy,Varrrrrrrrrrom!
joy,Hey-hey good lookin’!
joy,Varrrrrrrrroom.
sadness,"All right, I’ll leave."
sadness,My bed’s so boring.
anger,Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about.
anger,This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at.
neutral,I mean.
anger,if you don’t get that...
anger,"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time."
anger,"And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!"
sadness,"Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore."
joy,Well neither do I!
anger,Hey!
neutral,"I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?"
neutral,Joey stuffing 15
neutral,Where were you?
neutral,"Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate."
neutral,"Oh, which museum?"
neutral,"No, answer his."
joy,"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars."
joy,She was totally at my mercy.
sadness,Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
neutral,"No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie."
joy,"She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away."
anger,How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.
joy,"Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now?"
joy,"No, there is no way! It can"
neutral,Why is your family
anger,He cannot play at our wedding!
anger,I mean everyone will leave!
anger,"I mean come on, that is just noise!"
anger,It’s not even a song!
neutral,"If you listen very carefully, I think its"
neutral,"So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?"
neutral,"Oh, yeah, sure."
neutral,"I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’"
neutral,"Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that."
joy,"Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?"
neutral,Yeah.
neutral,"You see, now, I would date this girl."
neutral,"She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire."
neutral,"I mean, that’s got to come in handy"
neutral,"Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?"
neutral,I don’t know.
neutral,Me neither.
neutral,Rachel.
neutral,I don’t know.  Me neither.
sadness,"Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost."
neutral,"Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win."
anger,Is that a secret or a lie.
neutral,"No, I let him win—Ross!"
anger,Would you tell her I let you win please?
neutral,Oh. Yeah.  Uh Chandler
anger,I am strong! I’ll show you!
anger,Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?
anger,Let’s go big bunny!
neutral,Okay. 1…2…3—Go!   I’m gonna kill myself!
neutral,"Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?"
neutral,Also an island.
neutral,"Hey, what time is it?"
neutral,02:17
neutral,Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
anger,"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
neutral,"Hey, you guys"
joy,Hey!
neutral,Who is it?
joy,It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!
joy,Hey!
anger,No I’m not.
anger,You’re making one right now!
neutral,And-
neutral,"Yeah, can I help you with something?"
joy,"Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her."
neutral,"Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller."
neutral,"Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars."
anger,And stop using my name!
joy,Hey!
joy,Hi Pheebs!
neutral,Are you moving out?
neutral,"No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's."
neutral,"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
neutral,"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
fear,"Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,"
joy,"Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs..."
neutral,"Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me."
neutral,"One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world."
neutral,"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies"
neutral,Which proves that I never lie.
neutral,I guess you don't.
sadness,Paolo made a pass at me.
fear,"I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out."
neutral,I’m not freaking out.
neutral,Why would I be freaking out?
neutral,"A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday."
anger,"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!"
neutral,"I mean, what’s the harm in that?"
sadness,Right here!
anger,"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel"
anger,Phoebe and Rachel!
sadness,"So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!"
sadness,"It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t."
neutral,Okay.
joy,Really?
neutral,"Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready"
neutral,I know! I know.
neutral,Okay.
anger,I’m gonna go tell Joey that  that you’re back. I was really worried about you.
neutral,"Hey, did she buy it?"
neutral,Totally.
neutral,So did Heldi show you the place?
neutral,"Yeah, it’s beautiful."
joy,I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
neutral,I know.
neutral,"Okay look, I have an idea."
neutral,"Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him."
neutral,And then whoever does gets the phone.
neutral,"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom."
sadness,"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
sadness,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin."
sadness,Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.
neutral,Joe.
joy,"Oh, I win! He’s got"
neutral,So you don’t know that’s
sadness,"I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding."
anger,She’s saving the rest for her divorce.
neutral,And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to
neutral,Well what happened at dinner?
anger,My parents spent the money for our wedding!
sadness,"Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!"
neutral,"Honey, it’s gonna be okay."
sadness,No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
neutral,"No, y’know what?"
neutral,It’s gonna be okay.
neutral,I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast.
neutral,Y’know?
neutral,"And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack."
neutral,"Dr. Geller, there’s a seat over here."
neutral,"Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I’m having my lunch at this table, here in the middle."
neutral,"I’m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he’ll sit with me."
neutral,I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
neutral,"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch."
sadness,"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division."
fear,"Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"""
neutral,"Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath."
joy,I’m Ross!
joy,"I’m divorced, and I have a kid!"
joy,I’m Joey! I’m an actor! I don’t know squat about dinosaurs!
anger,"I’m Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me."
joy,"All right, there you go!"
anger,"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!"
neutral,"I’m Andrew, and I didn’t pay for this pear."
joy,"Okay, good-good for you."
neutral,"I’m Rhonda,  and these aren’t real!"
neutral,I’m Scott.
neutral,"Yeah, okay, Scott!"
fear,And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
neutral,So thanks for the warm welcome.
joy,"It’s good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play."
neutral,I hope you do too.
joy,"Now, let’s go out there and get ‘em!"
neutral,"And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team."
joy,"Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody"
neutral,You! Chuckles! What’s your name?
fear,"Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah..."
neutral,"No-no, I heard what you said, funny."
joy,I like funny.
joy,"This team is about hard work, but it’s also about having fun."
joy,Good to have you aboard Bing!
neutral,Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
neutral,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?"
neutral,They're gonna call her Chandler.
neutral,"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?"
neutral,Works on you.
joy,"Oh, that is so sweet."
joy,"No, no, ok, you hang up."
joy,"Ok, ok, one, two, three."
joy,Well you didn't hang up either.
joy,She didn't hang up either...
joy,"Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y—"
neutral,"Ross, hi, it's Rachel."
neutral,"I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your"
neutral,"Rach, I got a message from you."
sadness,"Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the."
sadness,"Ohh, ohh."
neutral,"Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
joy,"Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!"
joy,Really? That's great!
joy,"I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her"
neutral,(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of
joy,"Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,"
joy,"Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one."
joy,Ben is way cuter than that kid.
neutral,"That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?"
neutral,"Joey, you look nothing like Ben."
anger,I look more like him than you do!
joy,"Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that."
joy,That really was some of your best work.
neutral,"Hm-hmm, I told you!  I can’t believe that I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work."
neutral,I have to be up in seven minutes.
neutral,"Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes"
neutral,Do you wanna?
joy,Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!
neutral,Oh okay. But y’know what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
neutral,No.
neutral,I’m Joey.
neutral,Kristen.
joy,"Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?"
neutral,Kristen.
neutral,Got it!  So
neutral,"So uh, do you live around here?"
neutral,Yeah!
joy,Yeah!
neutral,Right down there.
neutral,Hey listen.. let me give you a little tip.
joy,Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
neutral,I’ll remember that.
neutral,"Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?"
neutral,"Oh I, I have plans tonight."
neutral,But how about tomorrow?
joy,"Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?"
neutral,"You look strong, why don’t I take that and you grab one of the boxes."
neutral,"Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, I’ll grab this one."
neutral,Hey.
neutral,"Listen, um..."
sadness,I'm sorry.
neutral,": Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'"
sadness,"That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!"
neutral,"Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
neutral,"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
anger,"Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me."
sadness,"You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over."
neutral,"By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me."
anger,"Oh, hello liar."
sadness,"Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike."
anger,I could’ve been killed I hope you know!
sadness,"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were"
joy,"Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects."
neutral,Phoebe.
anger,What?!  What the hell?!
anger,"All right, y’know what?"
anger,"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back."
anger,"Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar"
anger,"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay."
joy,Great! Great!  You’re making the bike very happy.
anger,Okay Ross!  Please don’t die!
fear,How could you have kept all of this from me?
neutral,"I was going to tell you, but"
anger,But what?! You figured you’d get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
anger,Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just…  Why don’t we just let the machine get that?
neutral,Hey Ross. It’s Joey. There’s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you’d know something about it.
neutral,"No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down."
joy,Everything on your application looks really good—Ohh!
anger,"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?"
neutral,"Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl."
joy,"Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?"
joy,You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I’ll be living here.
sadness,"Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it."
fear,That thing was a hazard!  I’m very safety conscious.
neutral,Hi.
neutral,"Hey man, how did the audition go?"
sadness,Estelle said I didn't get it.
joy,"Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me."
neutral,"For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around."
neutral,"No, from now on, I’m staying in one place."
neutral,Right here.
neutral,"Well, it’s getting late."
neutral,"Yeah, we’re gonna go."
neutral,"Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?"
neutral,"Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York."
neutral,"Yeah, it’s a very large plane."
neutral,That’s cool.
neutral,"But, we’ll stay here with you."
joy,"Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, y’know, but you don’t have to rub my butt."
neutral,"Oh-okay, I get the game now."
neutral,"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?"
joy,Oh yeah!
neutral,"Well okay, so then you’re fine."
neutral,The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
neutral,Okay?
neutral,So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
neutral,"It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble."
neutral,"Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?"
neutral,No.
neutral,Noooo!!
neutral,"Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye."
neutral,"Umm, nothing. I mean, I’m getting married next week."
neutral,Okay.
fear,"Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong."
neutral,"But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together."
neutral,"So, why don’t we just start over okay?"
neutral,And you can just tell me about yourself.
neutral,All right.
neutral,Okay.
neutral,"I write erotic novels, for children."
neutral,They’re wildly unpopular.
neutral,"Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D."
joy,"Yeah,  a Pretty Huge"
sadness,"So, uh, how's she doing?"
sadness,The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
sadness,"How-how are you, Mom?"
anger,"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?"
neutral,Nothing.
neutral,"Oh, maybe that's it."
anger,"She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
neutral,"Okay, relax, relax."
neutral,"We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover."
neutral,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
joy,"Oh, you know what I loved?"
joy,Her Sweet 'n' Los.
joy,How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
neutral,"Not just restaurants, from our house."
neutral,Maybe.
neutral,In the hall.
neutral,"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping."
neutral,But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.
neutral,"Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."
neutral,"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."
joy,That's a good one!
neutral,"Hey, Joe."
neutral,"Dad, Ronni's here."
neutral,"So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal."
neutral,Anything at all.
neutral,But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
joy,"Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest."
anger,I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!
neutral,"Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah."
anger,Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut.  Hi!
neutral,I’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
anger,Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A
sadness,"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers."
joy,"So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?"
neutral,"Okay, you’re fine."
neutral,You’ll see.
joy,"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen."
neutral,"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles"
neutral,"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and…  You go."
neutral,"But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place at any other time."
neutral,"Really, it’s fine, whatever you want."
joy,It’s perfect.
joy,"And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain"
anger,Well then we’ll get wet.
sadness,Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.
neutral,Coming.
anger,I have a bone to pick with you.
fear,Uh-oh.
anger,Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
joy,That’s right! That’s right!
neutral,Oh that.
anger,Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!
anger,Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true!
neutral,Okay.
neutral,"And if it were true, how"
neutral,Ms. Monroe…  Oh there you go.
anger,"Look, don't you see what's happening here."
anger,"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant."
neutral,Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
fear,What am I going to do?
neutral,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that."
fear,I don't know you guys.
anger,"And before you know it, she's with him."
anger,"And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'"
anger,"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'"
joy,"And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'"
neutral,He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
neutral,"This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor."
neutral,Great. Great.
neutral,"Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I’ve got you, me, and Chandler and I’m gonna invite Gunther ‘cause, well, we’ve been talking about this pretty loud."
neutral,I’ll be there.
neutral,"Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there."
neutral,"Yeah. Tell ya what, let’s not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!"
neutral,Okay! We’ll need a six-pack of
neutral,"Hey guys, what are you doing?"
neutral,"Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler."
sadness,"Oh, come on!"
neutral,"Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him."
neutral,"Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there."
neutral,"Well, Chandler will be there for you too."
neutral,"I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there."
neutral,"And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot."
neutral,What do ya say? What do ya say?
neutral,"Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names."
neutral,"But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk."
sadness,I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!
sadness,"What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well."
joy,"Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar..."
neutral,Nothing! It's an expression.
neutral,No it's not.
neutral,Don't listen to your mother.
neutral,"You're independent, and you always have been!"
neutral,"Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!"
neutral,"And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles..."
neutral,PBS Telethon.
neutral,Hi Joey.
joy,Hey Pheebs!
neutral,I
anger,"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not"
sadness,"Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!"
sadness,Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
sadness,"Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag."
sadness,I don't wanna give up the bag.
anger,I don't have to give up the bag!
sadness,Do I Rach?
anger,"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!"
neutral,"Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it"
sadness,I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
sadness,I can't believe I'm hearing this!
sadness,Wait a minute!
anger,Wait a minute!
neutral,"I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial."
neutral,"Yeah umm, they're called wallets."
neutral,I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
joy,"Okay, great."
neutral,They say he's only got half a tank left.
anger,We're switching rooms again.
anger,"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room."
joy,Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
anger,"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?"
neutral,Uh-huh.
neutral,Chandler!
anger,Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
anger,Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
joy,Hey!
joy,"Oh, I wouldn’t miss this."
joy,"Well, I’m very glad you’re here."
joy,"Oh, you’re such a gentleman.  Come on! We’re going to my place!"
joy,Hey!
neutral,Hey-hey.
neutral,So are guys doing okay?
neutral,"Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important."
neutral,Do you have a minute?
neutral,"Well yeah, sure, what’s up?"
neutral,I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch…by guys.
neutral,Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
joy,"Oh, did you not want people to know that?"
joy,But I’m not gay. And I especially wouldn’t want you to think I was gay.
neutral,Why’s that?
neutral,I don’t think I should say.
neutral,"Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things."
neutral,Okay.
neutral,‘Kay.
neutral,Well
neutral,Yeah.
neutral,I’d love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
neutral,"Yeah, she’s gay."
neutral,Here you go.
joy,"Great! All right, so I’ll call you later."
joy,Great!
neutral,That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.
neutral,"No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey."
anger,Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
sadness,What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.
anger,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs."
neutral,"But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you."
neutral,"All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane."
neutral,Who’s Elaine?
joy,Can you people not see me?!
neutral,"So, will you talk to him?"
neutral,I don’t know Rach.
anger,"Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free"
anger,One!  No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back!
joy,Hey!
joy,Hi!
neutral,"Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?"
neutral,We need a porn break.
neutral,"We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again."
joy,"Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?"

neutral,"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan."
neutral,What’s the second part of your plan?
neutral,Yes that’s right.
neutral,"I tired attacking two women, did not work."

anger,"Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!"
neutral,But I couldn’t.
anger,That’s why I’m here.
neutral,Maybe we could attack them together?
neutral,That-that’s a no.
sadness,"What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!"
anger,"Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!"
anger,I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
anger,"All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you."
neutral,"No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything."
neutral,No. That’s not what I’m saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
joy,I like that.
neutral,"Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle."

neutral,Hello?
neutral,"Hello, is Ross there?"
neutral,"Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message?"
neutral,"Yes, this Russell, Ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven’t heard from him, I assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try."
joy,"Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!"
neutral,Oh!  She’s growing inside you.
joy,I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
joy,Oh hey you guys!
neutral,"Sure, I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya.  What uh—How come you’re not going?"
neutral,I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
neutral,I thought you already have a job.
neutral,And people say you don’t pay attention.
neutral,"No, this is a much better job."

neutral,That’s what I do now.
neutral,"Hey Joey, come taste this."
neutral,What is it?
anger,Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well…  I’m getting my revenge!

joy,"Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!"
joy,"""Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."""
sadness,"The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don’t ya?"
neutral,"So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?"
sadness,We’re never gonna find anybody.
joy,Well then let me do it!
joy,Joe
neutral,No-no-no!
neutral,"Look, I’ve been thinking about it."

neutral,So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.
anger,"I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts!"
joy,Everyone knows I’m an ass man!
neutral,That is true.
joy,"Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you."
joy,It’ll be me!
joy,And I swear I’ll do a really good job.
joy,"Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me."
joy,It might be kinda cool.
joy,So I can do it?
joy,Ah-ha! Too cocky!
fear,I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
neutral,Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.
anger,What the hell is that?
neutral,You said there was a gas leak in here.
neutral,Well why don’t you use your key?
neutral,"Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded."
neutral,"If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions."
anger,Come on!
sadness,Hurry up.
neutral,Oh! We could have done that.
neutral,"Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about."
sadness,"Oh, I’m so sorry."
sadness,"Um, and maybe I’m wrong!"
neutral,"I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more."
neutral,"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat."
anger,"Oh, but it’s made her so happy."
neutral,Little girl misses her cat.
sadness,Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
neutral,"Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her."
neutral,Yeah.
neutral,Thank you.
neutral,I

neutral,"Oh-no, he’s right."
joy,Seven hundred bucks!
joy,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
joy,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something."
neutral,"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
neutral,Oh.
neutral,Y'know those are a delicacy in India.

anger,"Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?"
neutral,I’d really prefer a mountain bike.
neutral,"Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me."
anger,"Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum."
neutral,"Oh, you want something serious."
neutral,"Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas."

fear,"No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you can’t, you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you can’t."
neutral,"Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is..."
sadness,What is the thing?

neutral,They were in his office.
sadness,"Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me."

joy,Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
neutral,How are you feeling?
neutral,You are
anger,I really wish that you wouldn’t.
neutral,"Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?"
neutral,"Then we can put you in bed, okay?"
neutral,Just smile and don’t talk to
joy,Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
joy,Pheebs!!
joy,Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!

joy,Come on! Speech!
anger,"Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!"
joy,"Oh-ho, I think it’s nice."
neutral,Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.
joy,Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
anger,Oh crap!
neutral,All right.
neutral,The super couldn’t figure out what it did.
sadness,A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did.
sadness,I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks.
joy,Thank God.
joy,"I guess Joey was right, it does nothing."
anger,See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.
sadness,Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
neutral,He doesn't have anyone.
anger,"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible."
joy,"Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!"
neutral,"Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing."
neutral,You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
neutral,"Y'know, we don't have to watch this."
joy,"No way, forget it."
anger,"C'mon, she's your mom!"
neutral,Exactly.
joy,"Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!"

anger,What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid
anger,"It’s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!"

neutral,Well..
joy,WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
neutral,Alan.
joy,He was unbelievable.
joy,"He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-..."
joy,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team."
joy,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.."
neutral,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
neutral,"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
joy,"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
joy,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
joy,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
joy,"Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’s the first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade,"
fear,"Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?"
neutral,Okay.
neutral,"All right, let’s start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?"
anger,What is she trying to kill me?
neutral,Are you hot?
neutral,"Okay, it must just be me then."
neutral,"That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?"
anger,You're driving me crazy with that!
neutral,"Okay, I'll stop."
anger,Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
anger,"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now."
neutral,You wanna play?
neutral,"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon."
neutral,And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
neutral,"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home."
joy,"All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?"
neutral,I'm intrigued.
neutral,"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid."
joy,"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back."
joy,"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts."
neutral,Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
neutral,"Uh yeah, right here."
joy,"Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?"
neutral,What's that?
neutral,"Weeeell, it's rum, and-"
neutral,I'm sure they'll be here soon.
neutral,"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
neutral,Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
fear,You are really frightening me.
fear,"Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?"
neutral,"All right, ten centimeters, here we go."
neutral,"All right, honey, time to start pushing."
fear,But they're not here yet!
neutral,"I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them."
fear,"Oh, god."
joy,"Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us."
neutral,"Yeah, I-I think I suggested that."
joy,"Aw, we-we are so… So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you."
joy,And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun.
neutral,Okay.
neutral,"I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun."
joy,"It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right?"
neutral,So where-where is it going?
neutral,That’s-that’s the real question.
joy,And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun.
neutral,"Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger."
fear,"No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you"
sadness,"I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?"
neutral,Y’know what?
joy,I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.
joy,I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .
anger,No?
joy,They taste so good.
neutral,Drum roll.
neutral,"Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?"
neutral,"Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney."
neutral,"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse."
anger,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life."
neutral,"Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson."
anger,You got problems because of you!
sadness,Not your name!
anger,"All right, this has got to stop!"
anger,Chandler is a great name!
sadness,"In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry."
neutral,"I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler."
neutral,It was.
sadness,"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me."
neutral,No.
neutral,"Thanks, any suggestions?"
fear,"Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and"
sadness,Well I was just so excited to see you.
sadness,No-no it’s not!
fear,I don’t want to lose you!
sadness,It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.
sadness,So I guess this is it.
sadness,Yeah.  Maybe it’s for the best. You smell just like her.
anger,"Yeah, so do you."
joy,Hey!
neutral,Hi.
neutral,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
sadness,Manhattan does not have enough stores.
neutral,"Well,"
neutral,Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
neutral,Um-hmm.

neutral,Okay.
sadness,"Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship"
fear,"I know! And I’m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!"
joy,Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
sadness,"Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time."
neutral,"No! No! Not, Paris."
joy,"Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?"
anger,"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!"
anger,When?
neutral,I don’t know exactly.
sadness,"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes."
joy,But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.
joy,"Ooh, this is it!  Oh, that’s him! That’s him!"
joy,Great! Go get him.
neutral,"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first."
neutral,He’s not really my type.
neutral,"No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything."
sadness,"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks."
sadness,You do attract some stinkers.
neutral,Chandler.
neutral,"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a"
neutral,"Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day."
neutral,"Oh, listen."
neutral,"If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them."
joy,Really.
neutral,Nothing at all.
joy,Really.
neutral,Nothing.
neutral,"Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?"
sadness,Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?
sadness,"No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict."
neutral,"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?"
anger,"No, no, I keep trying, y’know?"
sadness,"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom."""
neutral,He may think I’m sick.
neutral,"Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with!"
neutral,"Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them."
neutral,That’s it.

neutral,We will.
neutral,"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles."

neutral,"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch."
anger,What are you talking about? Bitch.
joy,I know you botched that operation on purpose.
anger,"I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder."
joy,"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!"
anger,Stop going through my stuff !
joy,Hey!
joy,Hey!
anger,"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey."
fear,"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea."
anger,"Please, what about you and Chandler?"
anger,That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
anger,Well hello !
neutral,What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
anger,"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!"
neutral,Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
joy,I'm gonna do it.
neutral,And I can't stop you.
neutral,No.
neutral,"Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?"
neutral,I'm smarter than
joy,"Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out."
joy,"Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up."
neutral,"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there."
neutral,"Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man."
joy,Sure.  Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.
neutral,No.

neutral,I’d love an ice water.
neutral,You got it.
anger,Just being friendly.
anger,"Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there."
neutral,"Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther?"
anger,Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.
sadness,"Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons."
neutral,No.
neutral,"Hey, waiter."
neutral,Yeah?
neutral,"You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening.  Yeah we are."
neutral,"Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum."
neutral,I’m calling for Monica Geller.
neutral,"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available"
neutral,Thank you.
neutral,Thanks.
anger,I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
neutral,Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
sadness,"This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again."
neutral,So go fix it!
neutral,Go find Chandler!
sadness,He's probably up in your room!
anger,Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
joy,Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
joy,"Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!"
neutral,Anybody lose this?
joy,Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
neutral,Hmm.
neutral,Do you remember where the duck food is?
neutral,Because I’m going to London.
neutral,"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him."
neutral,"Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back."
fear,"I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!"
fear,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does."
sadness,But I have to tell him how I feel!
neutral,He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
sadness,That’s not why you’re going!
sadness,"You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach."
sadness,"Forget that British chippy."""
sadness,No!
sadness,Because he’s in love with the British chippy!
anger,"Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!"
anger,"Y’know, it’s too late!"
sadness,You missed you’re chance!
sadness,"I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over."
anger,"Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, ""I do."""
joy,"I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter."
neutral,So is everybody here?
neutral,I got here a little early myself.

neutral,Here.
neutral,Here.
neutral,Now as for the hydrosaurs
neutral,"Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night."
sadness,"I’ve ah, I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry."
sadness,"So, do you think you can forgive me?"
joy,Great.
joy,Thanks.
neutral,"Okay, bye."
neutral,"Hello, Jennifer?"
neutral,"Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too."
anger,Hey!
neutral,Hi.
neutral,Are you all right?
fear,Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
joy,Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
joy,I’m like the one who talked him into it.
sadness,I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
sadness,And you really think this is a good idea?
neutral,"I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people."
sadness,I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.
joy,Especially Ross!
neutral,"Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later."
joy,"There he goes, your fiancée."
neutral,I guess so.
neutral,Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
sadness,"Oh, that is so unfortunate."
neutral,What?
joy,Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
neutral,"Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone."
neutral,You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.
neutral,"Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye."
joy,Bye-bye!  That’s why I moved out.
neutral,"Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore."
neutral,I think on some levels she already knows.
neutral,Night Mon. Night Julio.
neutral,Adiós.
neutral,"Ah actually, that is mine."
neutral,"Oh yeah, what are you reading?"
neutral,"Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?"
neutral,"Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?"
neutral,"I thought I would, but the translation's no good."
neutral,Your a poet and don't know it.
neutral,"Actually I ah, I am a poet."
neutral,"Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?"
neutral,"Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip."
neutral,Mine?  Right here?
joy,I can write an epic poem about this lip.
joy,"How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it."
neutral,"Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal."
neutral,"I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win."
neutral,We’re at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
neutral,"Yes we are. So, coffee?"
neutral,"Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?"
neutral,"Oh, no. But it’s just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia."
neutral,"Okay, here’s batch 22."
anger,"Oh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s."
neutral,"This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg."
neutral,Let’s give it a shot.
neutral,"No, just a Friday night."
neutral,Would she?
anger,Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
sadness,"I know honey, I’m sorry."
sadness,"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in."
joy,"Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!"
sadness,"Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t...."
anger,Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
fear,"I’m sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah...."
anger,"It’s not funny, this is actually my job."
neutral,"Oh believe me, I-I-I’ve been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus."
joy,"Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here."
joy,And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
neutral,"Ah, just one other thing."
joy,Yes?!
neutral,"I ah, I work at"
neutral,Do you want my pickle?
neutral,Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
neutral,"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
neutral,Phoebe.
neutral,"Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression."
joy,"Where?  Ooh, come to Momma."
anger,"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
joy,We should do something. Whistle.
anger,We are not going to whistle.
neutral,"Come on, do it."
anger,No!
joy,Do it!
anger,No!
joy,Do it do it do it!
joy,Woo-woo!
neutral,"Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s."
neutral,"I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance."
joy,I don’t see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
anger,"Either eat it, or be in it."
joy,"Spoon?  So, what do you think?"
joy,Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. there’s a new class comin’ in.
neutral,"Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?"
neutral,I can.
neutral,"Okay, go ahead."
neutral,"Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon."
neutral,"That’s very good, what’s your name?"
neutral,Monica.
neutral,"Monica, you go to the head of the class."
joy,Okay.
neutral,"And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen."
neutral,But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.
neutral,Human spleeeen.
joy,Olé!
joy,"Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!"
joy,Great!
joy,Yeah!
joy,"It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!"
joy,"Yeah, ""You suck"" and ""shut up and go home""."
joy,Listen Phoebe...
neutral,Yeah.
neutral,"You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but..."
neutral,But what?
neutral,This is kind of a classy place.
neutral,"Ok, say no more."
sadness,"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."
neutral,"Well, I've brought some books. We could read."
joy,"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet."
joy,Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
neutral,"I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention"
neutral,"Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?"
sadness,We can't. We're not pharmacists!
neutral,"I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba..."
neutral,Kate Miller?
neutral,Kate Miller it is.
joy,And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
neutral,In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
neutral,Thank you.
sadness,"We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry."
anger,This year was supposed to be great!
sadness,"No. No, you're not a loser."
anger,Look at me!
joy,"Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!"
sadness,"Oh, be-because of the leather pants."
joy,"See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something."
joy,That really is something.. that's really cool.
joy,Howdy partner!
joy,Maybe I should get another pair!
joy,"Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides."
joy,I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.
joy,I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
joy,I would make a good cowboy.
neutral,"Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry."
neutral,"Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep."
anger,"No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!"
neutral,Great nap.
neutral,It really was.
joy,"Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are."
neutral,"So, let’s talk about women. I’m sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life."
neutral,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin’?"""
neutral,"Hey, how you doin’?"
neutral,Hey Mikey
neutral,Hey P
neutral,What are you doing?
neutral,Setting rattraps
neutral,"No, no, to test his neck strength."
anger,"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!"
sadness,"I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
neutral,"Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps."
neutral,"I'll find Bob, I'll get him."
fear,Bob?
sadness,Bob!
anger,Robert!
neutral,"Oh wait, I think I hear him."
neutral,Better think of a new name for him.
neutral,"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl."
neutral,"I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ..."
sadness,"Oh my god, we killed Bob!"
neutral,"Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse."
neutral,Suzie
joy,"Hmmm, soup!"
neutral,"Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?"
neutral,"Oh yeah, no problem."
neutral,Thanks.
sadness,"Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection."
anger,"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!"
anger,"So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party."
anger,"I said, ""No!"""
neutral,Which puts
anger,Great. So the ball is in his court?
anger,Ball? There is no ball.

neutral,"No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy."
neutral,Are you close with them?
neutral,"No-no, they're not very nice people."
neutral,"Okay, listen, I really like you."
neutral,Okay?
neutral,I think this can go somewhere.
neutral,"So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?"
neutral,"Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of"
neutral,Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
neutral,"Yeah, okay, I'll see you later."
sadness,It’s over.
sadness,"Oh, was it awful?"
sadness,"Well, it was loong."
neutral,"I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head."
sadness,"Anyway, she didn’t want to stay."
neutral,I called a cab. she just left.
neutral,I wrote you a letter.
joy,Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
neutral,It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about.
neutral,"Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff."
neutral,"Okay.  Wow, it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning.  So, I’d better get cracking on this baby."
neutral,"Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done."
joy,"Okay, I’ll be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting."
anger,The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
neutral,"Well, you said that we except the"
neutral,"All right, that I’ll retract."
anger,"Hey! I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious."
neutral,Lebanon.
anger,"Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them."
neutral,How long is this gonna take? ‘Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
neutral,"Okay, then what happened?"
anger,Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!
neutral,"Hey Pheebs, what's going on?"
anger,Nothing!   This is not over!
anger,No! No! No!
sadness,"I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in…  Actually, thanks!"
neutral,All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
sadness,"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it."
sadness,"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now."
neutral,"Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff."
neutral,"That's okay, Joe."
neutral,"All right, let's go Pheebs."
joy,That was amazing.
neutral,I know.
joy,"Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?"
joy,We may have just started a family.
joy,"Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby."
neutral,"And if not, we got to do it on a bucket."
anger,Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!
anger,I knew it!
anger,I always knew she liked him!
anger,"Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are!"
neutral,Right?
anger,"We just broke up, first thing she does!"
neutral,You didn’t just break up.
anger,"Hey, it’s been like three weeks!"
neutral,"Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?"
joy,Oh yeah!
joy,"Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily."
neutral,"Well, there's this one thing… Okay,  here goes."
neutral,What?
sadness,Oh God.

anger,Oh not again!
sadness,This-this happened when my grandfather died.

neutral,"Okay, what do you guys think?"
sadness,I have never known love like this.
neutral,I stole Monica’s and changed the name.
neutral,You can’t
joy,If he goes first he can!
anger,Yeah!
neutral,"Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know?"
neutral,"Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him."
joy,Oh wow that’s a great idea! And
neutral,Here you go.
joy,"Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one."
neutral,Here you go.
neutral,"Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t get Chandler."
neutral,"Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get all upset."
sadness,All the time?
anger,All the time!
neutral,"Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog."
neutral,I’m all done.
joy,Thank God.
neutral,I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
neutral,Oh right.
neutral,Right.
joy,"Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried?"
sadness,We’re probably too old to do that now.
joy,"I’ll always remember that summer, because it’s when I got all of these freckles."
joy,Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.
neutral,"Well I’m, I’m a little slow.  Just as our children would be."
neutral,Relax every muscle in your body.
neutral,Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
neutral,"Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place."
neutral,"Okay, tell me your happy place."
joy,"Richard's living room, drinking wine."
anger,"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!"
sadness,"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
neutral,"Well, okay, fine, use my happy place."
neutral,"Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything."
neutral,"All right, I'll try not to."
neutral,"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
sadness,Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
joy,"All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
sadness,"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
neutral,"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place."
neutral,Okay.
joy,"Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains."
neutral,And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
neutral,"OK sweetie, I'll see you later."
neutral,See you later Rach.
neutral,Bye-bye Julie.
neutral,Hey.
neutral,Hey.
joy,"Hey, c'mon, cut it out."
neutral,Hey?
neutral,What?
neutral,Can I ask you somethin'?
joy,"Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower."
neutral,Ok.
neutral,"Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?"
neutral,What's up?
neutral,F.Y.I..
neutral,I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.
neutral,Her name is Stephanie... something.
neutral,She's supposed to be very good.
sadness,"Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her."
neutral,Uh...
fear,"Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?"
sadness,"Ahh, no."
neutral,Oh.
anger,"Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all."
anger,I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
joy,You are totally jealous.
anger,I'm not jealous.
neutral,"All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers."
neutral,"And y'know, and um, I..."
neutral,"Honey, I love you too."
sadness,"Ugh. Wait, wait, wait."
joy,"Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know."
neutral,"Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper."
joy,Don’t say anything.
neutral,"I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think."
joy,"I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now."
joy,Rachel! Rachel!
neutral,What?
neutral,"Oh, sorry."
neutral,"Um,  Barry."
joy,Awwwww
joy,Dude!
joy,And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
joy,All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
neutral,"Well actually, Ross doesn't."
neutral,"Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
neutral,Dear Mary-Angela.
neutral,Hi.
neutral,How?s it going.
sadness,This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.
anger,How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
neutral,"Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba."
neutral,"All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person."
neutral,At least you know her name.
neutral,"You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy."
fear,What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
sadness,Where in Cuba?
neutral,Hey.
sadness,"You uh, you may have been right about Jill."
sadness,"Umm, she kissed me."
neutral,All right.
neutral,"Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?"
neutral,A two and a five.
joy,"Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!"
neutral,"Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again.  What do you got?"
neutral,A four and a nine.
neutral,No. Why?
joy,Damn! I am good at Cups!
neutral,I’m still on the set!
anger,Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
sadness,"I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this."
sadness,Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.
anger,"No! No, I’m the minister! Alright, look-look, put ‘em both on the phone, I’ll marry them right now."
sadness,"Ugh! Joey, I have to go."
anger,Hey! Don’t you hang up on me! I’ll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
joy,Oh hey Joey! What's up?
neutral,"I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?"
neutral,"Yeah, I've been around."
neutral,"Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?"
neutral,"Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees."
joy,Great! Problem solved!
sadness,"Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance."
neutral,"All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control."
sadness,"Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town."
anger,Bastard!
joy,"Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it."
joy,I mean I think it's great!
neutral,For him.
neutral,She might be able to do better.
neutral,Hey guys!
neutral,Joey! Come here! Come here!
neutral,Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
neutral,You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
neutral,"No. Joey, she"
neutral,"Yes, but y'know what?"
neutral,It doesn't matter who knows what.
neutral,"Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!"
joy,Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
neutral,"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
neutral,"Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things."
sadness,"I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids."
sadness,And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a
neutral,"Well, things change."
sadness,I don’t want them to move to a
neutral,It’ll be okay Joe.
neutral,Mrs. Braverman must be out.
sadness,She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.
fear,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake."
fear,No that could kill her.
neutral,"Well, we don’t want that."
neutral,"No, so we’re protecting her."
neutral,But we should take it.
fear,But we should move quick.
fear,Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
fear,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
neutral,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
neutral,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
neutral,"Well, you're gonna."
neutral,"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
neutral,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
neutral,"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women."
sadness,"And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?"
neutral,"Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
neutral,"Hey, you're not him."
neutral,You're you.
neutral,"When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
neutral,No.
neutral,No.
neutral,You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
neutral,"Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!"
neutral,"And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
joy,You really think so?
neutral,Yeah. I really do.
neutral,"Thanks, Chandler."
anger,Get off!
neutral,Hi.
neutral,"Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?"
neutral,"When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?"
neutral,And the cream?
neutral,Cheese makes me thirsty.
neutral,Okay. Let’s move on.
neutral,All right.
neutral,I don’t know anything about cooking.
neutral,"I had to ask someone what it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles."
joy,"Well, hats off to the chef."
neutral,"I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?"
joy,The chef!
joy,That’s right.
neutral,"Hey, Pheebs."
neutral,Hey.
neutral,How's it going?
joy,Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
neutral,So what's going on?
neutral,"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger."
neutral,"I dunno, there's just something about..."
neutral,Basically we just feel that he's...
sadness,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
neutral,Uh-huh.
neutral,Okay.
neutral,"Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
sadness,We're sorry.
joy,Hey!
joy,Hey!
neutral,What are you doing?
neutral,I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
fear,Yes that was mine.
neutral,Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
sadness,Yes that would have made more sense.
anger,"Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!"
neutral,"All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time."
neutral,"And whatever you say, I'll believe ya."
anger,"Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?"
anger,"Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?"
neutral,"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball."
neutral,"She said, ""If I’m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."""
joy,Postpone it?
anger,"Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?"
anger,"Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?"
neutral,This isn’t right.
sadness,"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right."
anger,I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
anger,Don’t you point your pants at me!
anger,We have no choice!
anger,"Anywhere that’s half-decent would’ve be booked months ago, Ross don’t you understand?"
anger,This is our wedding I’m talking about.
neutral,The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.
anger,So what are you saying? It’s now or never?
neutral,No. I’m saying it’s now.
anger,Or?
anger,There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
anger,It’s not the pants.
anger,It’s you that is backwards.
anger,"And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all!"
sadness,"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—"
neutral,"Hi, honey."
neutral,See you later.
joy,"What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!"
anger,Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
neutral,"Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I’m calling for Monica Geller."
neutral,"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available"
fear,"Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!"
anger,NOOOO!!!!!!!!
neutral,I came to give you this  and this.
neutral,"Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice."
neutral,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
neutral,"Yeah, yeah, all the time."
neutral,"But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy."
anger,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap"
neutral,Check this out. Can I have this?
neutral,What?
neutral,"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti."
neutral,"All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office."
joy,"It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job."
sadness,"If it's not you, this is a horrible story."
joy,"Fortunately, it is me."
joy,"And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much."
joy,"Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate."
neutral,"Y'know, someplace nice."

anger,"I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright?"
fear,"This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”"

neutral,He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.
neutral,Oh well.
neutral,And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
joy,"Oh. Oh, that’s great!"
neutral,"Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal."
joy,That’s a good one.
joy,"Yeah, you’re funny."
joy,Oh thank God!
joy,"Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these!"
neutral,"Umm, oh here—Do you want a good one?"
neutral,"Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge."
